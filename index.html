      Welcome to my website!{% sidenote 'initials' 'The first three letters of &quot;jablevine&quot; are my initials, not a threat. Adam is my middle name; Bone is my mom&#x27s maiden name.'%}{% sidenote 'adam' 'If you need a trick to tell the difference between me and the other Adam Levine, just surreptitiously check under our shirts. I&#x27m the one <i>without</i> &quot;CALIFORNIA&quot; tattooed across my stomach.'%} I am an economics pre-doc in Sierra Leone, working on an electrification RCT under Professor Mushfiq Mobarak (Yale University), Professor Maarten Voors (Wageningen University), and Dr. Niccol√≥ Meriggi (IGC). Previously, I worked as a junior aerospace economist for <a href="https://brycetech.com/">Bryce Space and Technology</a>, supporting the NASA Chief Economist, the Air Force Office of Commercial & Economic Analysis, and commercial space companies.{% sidenote 'bryce_work' 'With the Bryce team, I researched <a href="https://brycetech.com/reports/report-documents/SIA_SSIR_2020.pdf">telecommunications satellites</a>, <a href="https://brycetech.com/reports/report-documents/Bryce_Metrics_Smallsat_Launch_Delays_2020.pdf">earth observation satellites</a>, and <a href="https://brycetech.com/reports/report-documents/Bryce_2020_Year_In_Review.png">rockets</a>.'%} I really like <a href="mailto:jablevine@gmail.com">getting email</a>.

      So far, my research has touched on migration, political economy, and agriculture, and how these topics effect{% sidenote 'effect' '<a href="https://xkcd.com/326/">https://xkcd.com/326/</a>'%} growth. I've also been lucky enough to do this research from very interesting places. I worked with <a href="https://harishsp01.github.io/">Prof. S.P. Harish</a> and his teams in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh for four months in 2018. Research on rural electrification also brought me to Afghanistan several times between 2018-2020{% marginfigure 'solar' 'assets/img/bamyan_solar.jpg' 'Thanks to my friends and colleagues at <a href="https://www.teamafghanpower.org/team-1">Team Afghan Power</a>, I have a solar field in Afghanstan named after me.'%}.

       Some people, on their websites, spell out their emails like jablevine at gmail dot com. I don't understand why this is common, but I really like getting email and this introduces more friction into the already hard process of sending someone a cold email. Please send me an email to <a href="mailto:jablevine@gmail.com">jablevine@gmail.com</a> explaining this. Or, I might get a torrent of spam email proving why people don't do what I'm doing.

        You can also give me anonymous feedback <a href="https://www.admonymous.co/jablevine">here</a>. Anything is useful and appreciated, especially feedback which is specific (&quot;You overuse the word immanentize.&quot;) and timely (&quot;You should move out of the way of that speeding trolley.&quot;).
