      Welcome to my website{% sidenote 'initials' 'The first three letters of &quot;jablevine&quot; are my initials, not a threat. Adam is my middle name; Bone is my mom&#x27s maiden name.'%}{% sidenote 'adam' 'If you need a trick to tell the difference between me and the other Adam Levine, just surreptitiously check under our shirts. I&#x27m the one <i>without</i> &quot;CALIFORNIA&quot; tattooed across my stomach.'%}! I am an economics pre-doc in Sierra Leone, working on an electrification RCT with Professor Mushfiq Mobarak (Yale University), Professor Maarten Voors (Wageningen University), and Dr. Niccol√≥ Meriggi (IGC). Previously, I worked as a junior aerospace economist for <a href="https://brycetech.com/">Bryce Space and Technology</a>, supporting the NASA Chief Economist, the Air Force Office of Commercial & Economic Analysis, and commercial space companies{% sidenote 'bryce_work' 'With the Bryce team, I researched <a href="https://brycetech.com/reports/report-documents/SIA_SSIR_2020.pdf">telecommunications satellites</a>, <a href="https://brycetech.com/reports/report-documents/Bryce_Metrics_Smallsat_Launch_Delays_2020.pdf">earth observation satellites</a>, and <a href="https://brycetech.com/reports/report-documents/Bryce_2020_Year_In_Review.png">rockets</a>.'%}. I really like <a href="mailto:jablevine@gmail.com">getting email</a>. I also really like <a href="https://calendly.com/jablevine/say_hi">talking to people</a>.

      Two broad themes which motivate me are the methodology and axiology of economic development. First, how do we turn poor places into rich places? Second, why is turning poor places into rich places valuable? On the practical side of development, I am interested in how the current aid apparatus responds to macroeconomic questions. No one actually has a plan to make Sierra Leone as rich as South Korea{% sidenote 'sk_gdp' '1975 South Korea had a GDP per capita of 500 USD, just below where Sierra Leone is today.'%}. What could that plan look like?

      So far, my research has touched on migration, political economy, and agriculture, and how these topics effect growth{% sidenote 'effect' '<a href="https://xkcd.com/326/">https://xkcd.com/326/</a>'%}. I've also been lucky enough to do this research from very intresting places. I worked with <a href="https://harishsp01.github.io/">Prof. S.P. Harish</a> and his teams in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh for four months in 2018. Research on rural electrification also brought me to Afghanistan several times between 2018-2020{% marginfigure 'solar' 'assets/img/bamyan_solar.jpg' 'Thanks to my friends and colleagues at <a href="https://www.teamafghanpower.org/team-1">Team Afghan Power</a>, I have a solar field in Afghanstan named after me.'%}.

       Some people, on their websites, spell out their emails like jablevine at gmail dot com. I do not understand why they do this, because I assume other people like getting email as much as I do, and this introduces more friction into the already hard process of sending someone a cold email. Please send me an email to <a href="mailto:jablevine@gmail.com">jablevine@gmail.com</a> explaining this. Or, I might get a torrent of spam email proving why people don't do what I'm doing.
