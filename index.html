      Welcome to my website!{% sidenote 'initials' 'The first three letters of &quot;jablevine&quot; are my initials, not a request for another vaccine. Adam is my middle name; Bone is my mom&#x27s last name.'%} I am a first-year PhD student with the Department of Economics at the University of Oxford.{% sidenote "phd" "Caveat: I'm kind of/not really a PhD student. My program is the ''<a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/mphil-dphil-economics">Integrated DPhil (2+2) in economics</a>,'' because Oxford just <i>has</i> to be special ðŸ™„. My class, starting in 2022, is the second class admitted to this program, which Oxford advertises as ''similar to that of the integrated five-year PhD ... at leading economics graduate schools worldwide.'' I'm just going to keep calling it a PhD until someone yells at me. " %}  Previously, I worked as an economics research assistant for Dr. Benjamin Tereick, a Research Fellow at <a href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/">GPI</a>, a research institute at the University of Oxford. Before that, I worked as a junior aerospace economist for <a href="https://brycetech.com/">Bryce Space and Technology</a>, supporting the NASA Chief Economist, the Air Force Office of Commercial & Economic Analysis, and commercial space companies.{% sidenote 'bryce_work' 'With the Bryce team, I researched <a href="https://brycetech.com/reports/report-documents/SIA_SSIR_2020.pdf">telecommunications satellites</a>, <a href="https://brycetech.com/reports/report-documents/Bryce_Metrics_Smallsat_Launch_Delays_2020.pdf">earth observation satellites</a>, and <a href="https://brycetech.com/reports/report-documents/Bryce_2020_Year_In_Review.png">rockets</a>.'%} I really like <a href="mailto:jablevine@gmail.com">getting email</a>.

      Before coming to Oxford, my research touched on migration, political economy, and agriculture, and how these topics effect growth. I've been lucky to do this research from very interesting places. For all of 2021, I lived in Sierra Leone, helping to design and implement research programs on energy and health economics. I worked with <a href="https://harishsp01.github.io/">Prof. S.P. Harish</a> and his teams in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh for four months in 2018. Research on rural electrification also brought me to Afghanistan several times between 2018-2020{% marginfigure 'solar' 'assets/img/bamyan_solar.jpg' 'Thanks to my friends and colleagues at <a href="https://www.teamafghanpower.org/team-1">Team Afghan Power</a>, there is a solar field in Afghanistan named after me.'%}.

       Some people, on their websites, spell out their emails like jablevine at gmail dot com. I don't understand why this is common, but I really like getting email and this introduces more friction into the already hard process of sending someone a cold email. Please send me an email to <a href="mailto:jablevine@gmail.com">jablevine@gmail.com</a> explaining this. Or, I might get a torrent of spam email proving why people don't do what I'm doing.

        You can also give me anonymous feedback <a href="https://www.admonymous.co/jablevine">here</a>. Anything is useful and appreciated, especially feedback which is specific (&quot;You use the word <i>heteroscedastic</i> too much.&quot;) and timely (&quot;You should move out of the way of that speeding trolley.&quot;).
