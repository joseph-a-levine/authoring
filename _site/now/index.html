<h2 id="april-2021">April, 2021</h2>

<p>I’ve been living in Freetown, Sierra Leone, since January. Life here is idyllic, if your version of idyllic allows for daily power outages, the occasional dog bite, and a rooster outside your window at 4:50am<label for="margin-figure-id" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="margin-figure-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/tufte-jekyll/assets/img/dennis.jpg" /><br />This is Dennis. It’s not clear why Dennis lives here, as we have no chickens.</span>. My favorite things about this city are the fresh pineapple, the view from my balcony the morning after a rainstorm, and the row of bars<label for="smoothie" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="smoothie" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Smoothie and otherwise </span> along the beach.</p>

<h2 id="reading-">Reading <a name="books"></a></h2>

<p>I’ve been reading to pass the time here, and there’s a lot of time to pass.</p>

<p><em>How to talk about books you haven’t read, by Pierre Bayard.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am often overwhelmed by the sheer number of books there are. Not because I won’t be able to read them all; I don’t enjoy most books I try to read.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then again, I’m doing exactly what Bayard said: “quote about making every book autobiographical.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Kindred, by Octavia Butler</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>best novel i’ve read about slavery</p>

<p><em>In defense of direct action, by Ivar Harding (pseudonym)</em> and <em>How to blow up a pipeline, by Andreas Malm</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When three moral philosophers announced the <em><a href="https://journalofcontroversialideas.org/">Journal of Controversial Ideas</a></em> in Spring 2020, Twitterers predicted a new front in the culture wars. The most interesting and inflammatory essay in the first volume<label for="releasted" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="releasted" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Out <a href="https://journalofcontroversialideas.org/volumes_issues/1/1">April 24th</a>. </span> does not, however, light up any particular field of political discourse.<label for="race" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="race" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">There are also several articles and responses, as expected, on gender identity and race. While I can’t comment on the content of those articles, I don’t doubt they qualify for inclusion. </span> Ivar Harding’s <em><a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.35995/jci01010002">In defense of direct action</a></em> makes a moral argument the use of coercive violence and sabotage by animal rights activists. He builds his case from Huemer’s common sense morality<label for="huemer" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="huemer" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Huemer, M., 2005, <em>Ethical Intuitionism</em>, Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire, England: Palgrave Macmillan.
 </span>: 1) violence is permissible to stop the torture of puppies; 2) there is no salient distinction between pigs and puppies; 3) there is no salient distinction between torture and factory farming; therefore 4) violence is permissible to stop the factory farming of pigs. I don’t recommend the paper on its merits, as the moral reasoning is occasionally imprecise<label for="sloppy" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sloppy" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">For example, Harding’s analogy between case <strong>F4</strong> and <strong>F5</strong> ignores morally salient aspects of state authority. Huemer (2013) does not. </span><label for="h2" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="h2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Huemer, M., 2013, <em>The Problem of Political Authority</em>, Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire, England: Palgrave Macmillan. </span> and the conclusions are lukewarm. Harding does not make the best moral case for direct action by animal rights activists. That case is best made in a book by Andreas Malm which is entirely focused on a different problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Malm has street cred. He may be an academic with the Swedish equivalent of tenure, but you can’t doubt that this is someone who takes his principles seriously. He has trespassed into coal plants in Germany, laid in front of coal trucks, and been arrested in street protests. The most disappointing part of his 2020 book <em>How to blow up a pipeline</em> is that it doesn’t deliver on the titular promise: besides a winking assertion that pipelines are “easily sabotaged” and a reference to successful Nigerian efforts, pipelines should not feel threatened.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This book is not meant to be an update to <em>The anarchist’s cookbook</em>. It is a moral call to arms for the climate movement: peaceful protest has failed, Malm argues. Or perhaps if it hasn’t failed, it’s too slow to succeed, which amounts to the same thing. He is clear in what he advocates instead: “Here is what this movement of millions should do, for a start: announce and enforce the prohibition…on new CO<sub>2</sub>-emitting devices. Put them out of commission, pick them apart, demolish them, burn them, blow them up.”<label for="should" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="should" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Pg. 67 </span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is none of Huemer’s intuitionism in Malm’s book. Malm is not making an emotional or common sense argument. Peter Singer is one of the founders of the <em>Journal of Controversial Ideas</em>, but his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine,_Affluence,_and_Morality#Summary">drowning child thought experiment</a> has no place in Malm’s rhetoric. For Malm, plan A has failed; we knew it had failed a decade ago. What’s taking us so long to get started on plan B?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite Harding’s initial intuitionism, in his final section he converges to Malm’s consequentialism: 
“[A]nimal rights activists must seriously consider whether the short­term gains of coercive direct action can justify its costs. In many cases, I think they cannot. For instance, actions such as writing graffiti, engaging in minor property damage, and issuing anonymous threats to medical researchers are likely to bolster negative sentiments about the animal rights movement without producing substantive countervailing benefits for animals.”<label for="conclu" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="conclu" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Pg. 23 </span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is quite the concession. Direct action is morally A-OK, Harding originally argued. He went further than Malm, who stops at sabotage, in permitting interpersonal violence. But, confronted with making a final recommendation, he retreats. Reading Harding’s conclusion, and comparing him to Malm, I made excuses for the animal rights activist. Maybe the public backlash to sabotage to protect animals is greater than the backlash to environmental sabotage. Or maybe the peaceful means of advocating for animal rights have not yet been exhausted, as they have by the climate movement. But Harding doesn’t deserve our charity: this retreat is cowardice. In the coming decades, the Animal Liberation Front and its allies will escalate: people will be hurt; people will go to jail. Harding, even shielded by anonymity, isn’t willing to stand by the common sense moral case which inevitably leads to that point.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For what it’s worth, I think both Harding and Malm are wrong. Neither of their causes is important, urgent, or tractable enough to make terrorism morally permissible.  What we gain in reducing emissions or meat consumption would be more-than-offset by the erosion on public safety, rule of law, and social trust.<label for="credit" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="credit" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">To his credit, Harding addresses this objection in Section Four. His analogy between civil disobedience  and direct action is flawed, however, in ignoring the <em>expected</em> differential effects in favor of the minimum differential effects. His discussion of the acceptance condition for civil disobedience provides support for, at most, blurring the line between protest and direct action. </span> The West is a remarkably low-terror society today: in 1970s America, there were <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/28/opinions/bergen-1970s-terrorism/index.html">112 domestic plane hijackings</a>. In 1971 and 1972, there were an <a href="https://time.com/4501670/bombings-of-america-burrough/">average</a> of five terrorist bombings <em>per day</em> in the US. This was also the hey-day of European left-wing bombings and hijackings, and of course the IRA.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite our disagreement on what action is permissible, my rejection of terrorism comes from the same moral calculus which Malm applies throughout his book, and which Harding applies in his  cowardly conclusion. We only disagree on magnitudes. Given that three people who endorse very different actions agree on a decision framework, where are the activists willing to act on this framework? In other words, why is there so little terrorism?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t know, but I <em>really</em> don’t want to disturb this equilibrium.<label for="slip" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="slip" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">For a positive example of a trust cascade, see <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w28603#fromrss">this paper</a>.  </span> Both climate activism and animal rights activism are, at their hearts, political causes, and there are many other political causes whose advocates are just as passionate. If coal power plants begin to experience sabotage by climate activists, might condo construction sites by NIMBYs? Direct action against water treatment plants which supply fluoride might be next. There are remarkably few terror attacks against abortion providers, for all the passion of anti-abortion activists. When societal norms against terrorism begin to degrade, you don’t get to control who take advantage.</p>

<h2 id="listening-">Listening <a name="music"></a></h2>

<p>Once, about 20 minutes into a 36 hour shift at my firehouse, I realized I forgot my headphones at home. Felt <a href="https://youtu.be/H9F0RzKBowc?t=78">like this</a>.</p>

<p>I brought three pairs of headphones to Freetown, not expecting</p>

<p><em>Civilian, Wye Oak</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is a book called <em>How to talk about albums you haven’t listened to</em> so much more ridiculous than one called <em>How to talk about books you haven’t read</em>? Everyone except the post-modernists sees books, even novels, even Calvino novels, as fixed. If two people have read the same book, they’ve had the same experience more or less. Not so with music. Society encourages a much more diverse realm of experience ascribed to music. I’ve heard Nivrana’s <em>Unplugged</em> related to someone’s honeymoon, a bad breakup, the Suez Crisis of 1956, and a chill evening getting high with friends. No one’s ever said, “I get that <em>The Kite Runner</em> gave you an appreciation of beauty in difficult times, but <em>I</em> associate it more with the degradation of the ozone layer.” The meaning is right there in the book!<label for="cherry" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="cherry" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Think I’m cherry-picking? 	<q>I get that <em>King Lear</em> illustrated the dangers of a vain and narcissistic ruler for you, but what I took away was that incest leads to decadence.<q> <em>Bayard</em> emphasizes that, even when the meaning, or multiple meanings, are clear, books often carry external meanings with them. &lt;/span&gt;</q></q></span></p>

<h2 id="writing-">Writing <a name="writing"></a></h2>

<p>On my first day as a consultant in 2019, someone joked that I didn’t have to download Microsoft Word because “you’ll always be working in PowerPoint anyway.”<label for="slides" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="slides" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">After two years of government consulting, I firmly believe at least a third of DC’s economy is generated by people a) making slide decks and b) reading them outloud to other people. </span> On my second day as a consultant, my new boss, the excellent <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2018/09/13/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E1245-3">Aschley Schiller</a>, told me that a client had requested we turn a beautiful slide deck into a 50-page report. This was said with a proper amount of regret for the loss of efficiency this transformation would represent.</p>

<p>Now, in a research position suspended between academia and NGOs, I often work in the opposite direction. After weeks of research, data collection, and analysis, we sit down and write. Only after producing a report or working paper can we make the slide decks.</p>

<p>In mid-April, two of my working papers were accepted for presentation at at the American Political Science Association’s meeting in October. Although my former professor and research advisor S.P. Harish has shepherded me through the process for one of these papers, I’ll be presenting both of them in Seattle this fall! Over the next few months, I’ll be spending a lot of time getting these two presentations down pat.</p>

<h2 id="eating-">Eating <a name="food"></a></h2>

<p>While I was living in India, I had a secret. It’s the kind of secret that will lose you friends in India. I successfully lived in Kolkata, Bangalore, and Lucknow for <em>months</em> with no one ever discovering that I don’t like mango.</p>

<p>I don’t hate mango, per se. It’s fine, I guess. It goes great in smoothies! But I just can’t muster any enthusiasm for the fruit. In Freetown, my ambivalence doesn’t matter, though, because the pineapple here is amazing.</p>

<p>Seriously — I would eat half a pineapple per day. These things are so fresh and so cheap, there’s nothing stopping me … except I am terrible at choosing them. Of the dozen I’ve brought home from one of the roadside stalls, our housekeeper Fatmatah has declared at least half of them unsalvageable. Some of these mistakes are forgiveable, like a slightly off-yellow color. Others are not: yesterday, I missed the fact that the bottom half of a pineapple had the consistency of a water balloon. When I’m particularly desperate, I’ll outsource my retail pineapple shopping to one of my housemates with a demonstrated ability.</p>

<p>Anyone in the pineapple business has it rough; I won’t hold this against them. Pineapples take almost two years to reach maturity, and those leaves are damn pointy. By now, I’m pretty sure that half of the women running fruit stands along western Freetown’s main road recognize me as an easy mark to offload past-ripe produce onto. I’m a willing dupe: I’m still chasing that pineapple high. And at some point I’m going to figure out how to choose a decent one for myself.</p>
