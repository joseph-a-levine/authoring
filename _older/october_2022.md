## September, 2022

Metrics, micro, macro. Measures, minimizers, magnitudes. Marshallian methods must make mockery of my motivation. matrices, μ, monotonicity; Malmqvist models mirth myopically? Moreover, myself maybe made mad, meaning "mental", mastering much minutiae modeling mankind's many monetary market messes. 

(The first month of economics grad school is going great. Let's dive in.)

## Reading 

I've done less re-reading of fiction this year than I usually do. In fact, I've been positively smug about how much new fiction I've exposed myself to this year.{% sidenote "nobel" "I'm writing this a few days after the Ernaux win (I lost about £30 on the betting markets, I had money on Murnane and Edna O’Brien). I'd never heard of Ernaux before reading through the contenders sheet last week; I doubt I'll read her but only because I have an inexplicable aversion to autofiction. " %} Earlier this month, however, I returned to one of my old favorites, Vikram Seth's *A Suitable Boy*. Seth wrote the book{% sidenote "tome" "I read it on kindle the first time, and was astounded to see the size of a hard copy, more than 1,100 pages! It read so fast while I was in Sierra Leone, about a week. Just now, I sprinted through in twelve days, but that felt like quite an achievement. " %}  instead of studying during his economics PhD at Stanford; he's joked that it took him "eleven years not to finish my PhD." I'm heartened to know I have a novelist/poet career to fall back on if the economics thing doesn't work out.

The novel is about a 19-year-old woman, Lata, being pushed towards marriage by her mother; Lata's choice comes down to three boys of varying suitability: Kabir, Haresh, and Amit. Much of the romantic story takes place in Kolkata, but action branches to Delhi, Lucknow, and Bihar. The *scope* of the novel led to overly confusing comparisons to *War and Peace*; Nehru shows up often, and the resignation of Rafi Ahmed Kidwai is covered in detail. Unlike Tolstoy, however, Seth has no eye for the political scope JOSEPH

The actual question of interest, much more central than Natasha, is who is most suitable for Lata? In my memory, before beginning my re-read, Amit was the only choice. I might have had a crush on him myself, and Seth draws him almost as a self-portrait — an Oxonian poet and novelist, already acclaimed in the West and Anglophone India, Amit is superlatively sympathetic. The most illustrative bits about him are massive spoilers, so I've put one of my favorite at the bottom; search for "Chatterji." But there's the deeply romantic potential of the bad-boy Kabir; being Muslim, his presence causes Lata's mother no end of stress. And Haresh is simply hardworking and adoring of Lata. Tho he starts pathetic, he grows on me the most throughout. At one point, on a train, he makes a list entitled "My Life:"{% sidenote "trapl" "Moreso than planes or buses, trains inspire lists with grandiose titles." %}

> *1. Must catch up with news and world affairs.* Haresh felt he had not come off well on this account during his meetings with the Mehras. But his work kept him so busy that sometimes he hardly had time even to glance at the papers. 
> 
> *2. Exercise: at least 15 minutes each morning. How to find the time?*{% sidenote "exc" "Ha." %}
> 
> *3. Make 1951 the deciding year of my life.*
> 
> *4. Pay off debts to Umesh Uncle in full.*
> 
> *5. Learn to control temper. Must learn to suffer fools, gladly or not.*
> 
> *6. Get brogue scheme with Kedarnath Tandon in Brahmpur working properly.* This he later crossed out and transferred to the work-related list. 
> 
> *7. Moustache?* This he crossed out, and then rewrote together with the question mark. 
> 
> *8. Learn from good people, like Babaram.*
> 
> *9. Finish reading major novels of T.H.*{% sidenote "hardy" "Thomas Hardy. This is likely the most autobiographical item on Seth's list." %} 
> 
> *10. Try to keep my diary regularly as before.*{% sidenote "comm" "Who hasn't written this in a diary before?" %} 
> 
> *11. Make notes of my five best and five worst qualities. Conserve latter and eradicate former.*
> 
> Haresh read over this last sentence, looked surprised, and corrected it.

*A Suitable Boy* is only slightly an economic novel, but it is an economical one. Seth's aversion to adverbs is second only to Stephen King's. When he does deploy them, it's done mockingly.

> The talkative [guppi] was asking Maan about his love life, and Maan was attempting weakly to fend off the questions. "People's love lives are not very interesting," said Maan, sounding unconvincing even to himself. 
>  
> "How can you say that?" said the guppi. "Every man's love life is interesting. If he doesn't have one, that's interesting. If he has one, that's interesting. And if he has two, that's twice as interesting." He laughed delightedly at his sally.

Another reason I'm partial to Seth is our similar taste in Shakespeare: *Twelfth Night*, my favorite of the comedies, plays an extended role in the plot. Lata is cast as Olivia;{% sidenote "vio" "''The girl who played Viola too was excellent, and Lata enjoyed falling in love with her.''" %} one of her suitors{% sidenote "disa" "The Muslim boy disapproved of by Mrs. Mehra." %}  is a talented, pathetic Malvolio. The version staged in the book, "Indian-movie-style, concluded with the last of four songs." And contemplating her niece prior to opening night:

> Sometimes, sitting here, with the marked script of Twelfth Night open on her lap, Lata substituted the word "happiness" for "greatness" in the famous quotation. She wondered what one could do to be born happy, to achieve happiness, or to have it thrust on one. The baby, she thought, had arranged to be born happy; she was placid, and had as good a chance as anyone of happiness in this world, her father's poor health notwithstanding.

Biography of Nehru

I'll throw in a long section, my favorite, to conclude. Amit is giving a seminar about his new novel to high society in Kolkata:

> "Do you believe in the virtue of compression?" asked a determined academic lady. 
> 
> "Well, yes," said Amit warily. The lady was rather fat. 
> 
> "Why, then, is it rumoured that your forthcoming novel — to be set, I understand, in Bengal — is to be so long? More than a thousand pages!" she exclaimed reproachfully, as if he were personally responsible for the nervous exhaustion of some future dissertationist. 
> 
> "Oh, I don't know how it grew to be so long," said Amit. "I'm very undisciplined. But I too hate long books{% sidenote "iron" "Quite self-aware, from a novelist on page ~900 of 1,100." %} : the better, the worse. If they're bad, they merely make me pant with the effort of holding them up for a few minutes. But if they're good, I turn into a social moron for days, refusing to go out of my room, scowling and growling at interruptions, ignoring weddings and funerals, and making enemies out of friends. I still bear the scars of Middlemarch." 
> 
> "How about Proust?" asked a distracted-looking lady, who had begun knitting the moment the poems stopped. Amit was surprised that anyone read Proust in Brahmpur. He had begun to feel rather happy, as if he had breathed in too much oxygen. 
> 
> "I'm sure I'd love Proust," he replied, "if my mind was more like the Sundarbans{% sidenote "sund" "The Sunderbans, a massive jungle straddling the coastal border between Indian and Bangladesh, is most famous as the likely setting Kipling's *The Jungle Book* [EDIT: This is a lie! I've been telling people this fact for years but it turns out Kipling probably had parts of Madhya Pradesh in mind.] The Sunderbans are also the place where I've seen the clearest Milky Way I've ever seen. " %} : meandering, all-absorptive, endlessly, er, sub-reticulated. But as it is, Proust makes me weep, weep, weep with boredom. Weep," he added. He paused and sighed. "Weep, weep, weep," he continued emphatically. "I weep when I read Proust, and I read very little of him." 
> 
> There was a shocked silence: why should anyone feel so strongly about anything? It was broken by Professor Mishra. "Needless to say, many of the most lasting monuments of literature are rather, well, bulky." He smiled at Amit. "Shakespeare is not merely great but grand, as it were." 
> 
> "But only as it were," said Amit. "He only looks big in bulk. And I have my own way of reducing that bulk,"{% sidenote "kindle" "I so, so, so fervently want to introduce Amit to a Kindle." %}  he confided. "You may have noticed that in a typical Collected Shakespeare all the plays start on the right-hand side. Sometimes, the editors bung a picture in on the left to force them to do so. Well, what I do is to take my pen-knife and slit the whole book up into forty or so fascicles. That way I can roll up Hamlet or Timon — and slip them into my pocket. And when I'm wandering around — in a cemetery, say — I can take them out and read them. It's easy on the mind and on the wrists. I recommend it to everyone. I read Cymbeline in just that way on the train here; and I never would have otherwise."{% sidenote "shakesp" "All three of Lata's suitors have affinities for Shakespeare, understandable individually, but cumulatively surprising. Kabir acted in *Twelfth Night*, and Haresh's 1951-to-do list was written after ''[it] occurred to him that he was behaving as stupidly as Hamlet.''" %} 
> 
> Kabir smiled, Lata burst out laughing, Pran was appalled, Mr Makhijani gaped and Mr Nowrojee looked as if he were about to faint dead away. Amit appeared pleased with the effect.





Reputations; Alice in Wonderland (lucy's gift); Stories of Your Life

One weird book was cited in three books I read in late October, frequently enough I had to pay attention.{% sidenote "baa" "Probably just a Baader-Meinhof coincidence, but a pretty surprising one." %} The forward to *Alice*, written by Peter Hunt, concludes that Charles Dodgson was almost surely a pedophile.{% sidenote "ase" "My metrics professor would deduct points for abusing measure theoretic notation here, but 'almost surely' and 'almost everywhere' have always seemed counterintuitive. JOSEPH FINISH" %} Hunt writes that "even the most sympathetic of Dodgson’s biographers [find] it necessary to face this particular problem directly (given that his index contains the item, ‘Dodgson, nude female form, attachment to’)." In this discussion, Hunt cites "James Kincaid’s pioneering *Child-Loving: The Erotic Child and Victorian Culture*," which  writes of the *Alice* books that they want to "stand on the threshold of ... a seduction drama." 

I thought little of this forward, until three days later, when reading Amia Srinivasan's collection *The Right to Sex*, I came across a familiar name: "Is there no difference in power between Kincaid, author of *Child-Loving: The Erotic Child and Victorian Culture*,{% sidenote "dunk" "His research interests are not relevant to Srinivasan's point — the title of his book is used as a dunk, one which lands quite well." %}  and his student?" Srinivasan, in "On Not Sleeping With Your Students," takes Kincaid to task for an "abus[ive], pornification" essay on how he interacts with his students.     Kincaid's story is fairly involed,{% sidenote "recei" "See page 132-136 of the paperback for the receipts, or search for Kincaid's name. Libgen is a thing." %} but Srinivasan's point is that Kincaid is a pedagogical failure: "[his] focus, as a teacher, should be on directing his student’s desire away from himself, and towards its proper object: her epistemic empowerment. If this is what the student wants already, then all Kincaid has to do is exercise some restraint, and not sexualise what is a sincere expression of her desire to learn."

I recommend the entire collection, and most of Srinivasan's other writing besides: an essay on [bestiality](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n19/amia-srinivasan/what-does-fluffy-think); an [obituary of Derek Parfit](https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2017/january/remembering-derek-parfit); an essay on [the Rhodes' legacy](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v38/n07/amia-srinivasan/under-rhodes). She's my favorite contemporary feminist philosopher, and my favorite living All Souls Fellow. Three of my friends sat for the [All Souls Examination Fellowship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Souls_College,_Oxford#Examination_fellowships) this year. While my prior is that none will be elected,{% sidenote "prior" "Just based on numbers — two fellows are elected annually, from ~400 applicants. All three of my friends are bash-you-over-the-head innovative thinkers who would hold their own in the University's smallest  & most intellectual college." %}  the process sounds delightful.  Recent exam questions include "'O tell me the truth about love’ [W.H. AUDEN];" "Have independent central banks been a failure?;" and "What is special about José Mourinho?" Besides Srinivasan and Parfit, fellows include Lawrence of Arabia,{% sidenote "arch" "Just went down an rabbit hole of his archaeological discoveries. Anyone, who, at 20 years old, ''cycled 2,200 miles solo through France to the Mediterranean and back researching French castles'' is owed an interesting life." %}  Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan,{% sidenote "radha" "Second president of India." %}  Amartya Sen,{% sidenote "pbuc" "I'm *so* glad I don't have to deal with social choice theory this year." %}  and Joseph Stiglitz.{% sidenote "stig" "It's odd that, of the six All Souls Fellows I just listed, I have the fewest opinions about the development economist." %} 








I recently found Zhengdong Wang's blog, which I place in the same category as this website, but much better. The highlight is his [README](https://zhengdongwang.com/readme) page, and the "Maximum Fun" section sourced some fantastic recommendations.{% sidenote "mafun" "Wang recommends *Intepreter of Maladies*, which was my absolutely superlative fiction book I read last year, and *Memoirs of Hadrian*, which was in the top ten. " %} He prompted me to finally watch *Knives Out*, which did not strike me as superlative, but was very very fun. The recommendation which worked out the best for me (so far), was Jeff Smith's *Bone* collection. Wang writes, "It feels like you got through a Lord-of-the-Rings-like experience in one sitting. The art is so sumptuous." I have never read/watched *Lord of the Rings*, and this feels like an odd way to get there, but I enjoyed *Bone* so much that I might try it. Also, Smith's shades-of-gray style looks beautiful on my extra-large e-ink tablet.

The Oxford Philharmonic is a delight — it's a surprise to find a prolific professional orchestra in such a small city. Since March, I've seen four of the great symphonies performed by at the Sheldonian Theater, along with five smaller showings. Tchaikovsky's 5th   
  
The Sheldonian is my favourite non-church designed by Wren, much preferred to the old hall at my semi-alma mater.{% marginfigure "wren" "assets/img/Bodleian_Plate.jpg" "The 'Wren Building,' on the campus of William & Mary, as depicted by the Bodleian Plate, was probably not even designed by Wren." %} The concert hall in the Sheldonian is tiny, every seat feels cramped. The D-shaped building is a single room — every wall you can see is an externally-facing wall. And every inch of room is used well.  From the top, down:  
1. The [ceiling mosaic](https://www.sheldonian.ox.ac.uk/building-history), painted by Robert Streater in 1669 and restored in 2008, is titled "Triumph of Truth and Learning over Envy, Rapine, and Ignorance." I spent most of Tchaikovsky's 5th distracted by the ceiling. The main circle consists of anthropomorphized versions of the courses taught at Oxford in the 17th century: Poesy poses with pipes; Mosaical law holds a set of double tablets; Astronomy rests on a giant astrolabe{% sidenote "astrola" "thanks, Lucy, for figuring this one out with me" %}; Chemistry clutches a crucible. On the south side of the ceiling are the titular outcasts: Envy, covered insnakes, falls away from the circle of divine coursework. Rapine and Ignorance, I learned later, are not visible due to the...  
2. ...Organ installed in the 1880s, which reaches to the ceiling. While the organ is gorgeous, I was disappointed to learn the beautiful facade is now entirely decorative. From an uncited forum comment:   


> "The organ was a 'Father' Willis of 1877. It was rebuilt by Willis III in 1927/8 to a design of H.P Allen, without any Swell reeds. Harrison & Harrison rebuilt it in 1963 with mutations and a Cromorne on the Choir organ, as was popular at that time.    
>   
> "The heating baked the organ, so in 1997 one of the Oxford alumni (a QC,) donated a synthetic instrument. It is said that the pipework remains in situ, though the loudspeakers are concealed within the rather splendid T.G. Jackson case."


3. I was seated directly under the stage-right proctor's box{% marginfigure "fasces" "assets/img/sheld_proctor.jpg" "Box for lion-eyed exam proctors." %} for Brahm's 1st symphony. I spent most of the intermission speculating with a friend (hi Anna) about the fasces-weilding lions, looking like something out of an Indiana Jones dungeon. The best theory we could come up with is that they are intended to intimidate students sitting their exam in the hall every June.  
  
In mid-June, I returned to the Sheldonian for the Philharmonic's season closing, a performance of Beethoven's Choral Fantasy and Choral Symphony, his 9th.   
  
Before each of these performances, I met friends at the White Horse, one of the innumerable 7+-century old pubs scattered around Oxford. The main virtue of the White Horse is it's proximity to the Sheldonian.

> Amit, needless to say, was disappointed, but not as much as he might have been. His novel, now that he was free from the worry of handling the Chatterji fortunes, was going well, and many more momentous events were taking place on his pages than in his life. He sank deeper into the novel, and — a little disgusted with himself for doing so — used his disappointment and sadness to portray that of a character who happened to be conveniently on hand. [...] Perhaps Lata had known that of the three men courting her, the only one who could be rejected without the loss of his friendship was Amit.
