title: What am I up to now?
---


## September, 2022

Metrics, micro, macro. Measures, minimizers, magnitudes. Marshallian methods must make mockery of my motivation. matrices, Î¼, monotonicity; Malmqvist models mirth myopically? Moreover, myself maybe made mad, meaning "mental", mastering much minutiae modeling mankind's many monetary market messes. 

(The first month of economics grad school is going great. Let's dive in.)

## Reading 

I've done less re-reading of fiction this year than I usually do. I've been fairly smug about how much new fiction I've exposed myself to this year.[^3] Earlier this month, however, I returned to one of my old favorites, Vikram Seth's *A Suitable Boy*. Seth wrote the book[^4] instead of studying during his economics PhD at Stanford; he's joked that it took him "eleven years not to finish my PhD." I'm heartened to know I have a novelist/poet career to fall back on if the economics thing doesn't work out.[^5]

A suitable boy

Reputations; Alice in Wonderland; Stories of Your Life

Bone

Bill James' crime book

Maybe some papers
