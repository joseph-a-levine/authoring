Metrics, micro, macro. Measures, minimizers, magnitudes. Marshallian methods must make mockery of my motivation. matrices, μ, monotonicity; Malmqvist models mirth myopically? Moreover, myself maybe made mad, meaning "mental", mastering much minutiae modeling mankind's many monetary market messes.

## Reading 

I've done less re-reading of fiction this year than I usually do. In fact, I've been positively smug about how much new fiction I've exposed myself to this year.{% sidenote "nobel" "I'm writing this a few days after the Ernaux win (I lost about £30 on the betting markets, I had money on Murnane and Edna O’Brien). I'd never heard of Ernaux before reading through the contenders sheet last week; I doubt I'll read her but only because I have an inexplicable aversion to autofiction. " %} Earlier this month, however, I returned to one of my old favorites, Vikram Seth's *A Suitable Boy*. Seth wrote the book{% sidenote "tome" "I read it on kindle the first time, and was astounded to see the size of a hard copy, more than 1,100 pages! It read so fast while I was in Sierra Leone, about a week. Just now, I sprinted through in twelve days, but that felt like quite an achievement. " %}  instead of studying during his economics PhD at Stanford; he's joked that it took him "eleven years not to finish my PhD." I'm heartened to know I have a novelist/poet career to fall back on if the economics thing doesn't work out.

The novel is about a 19-year-old woman, Lata, being pushed towards marriage by her mother; Lata's choice comes down to three boys of varying suitability: Kabir, Haresh, and Amit. Much of the romantic story takes place in Kolkata, but action branches to Delhi, Lucknow, and Bihar. The *scope* of the novel led to overly confusing comparisons to *War and Peace*; Nehru shows up often, and the resignation of Rafi Ahmed Kidwai is covered in detail. Unlike Tolstoy, however, Seth has no eye for the political scope JOSEPH

The actual question of interest, much more central than Natasha, is who is most suitable for Lata? In my memory, before beginning my re-read, Amit was the only choice. I might have had a crush on him myself, and Seth draws him almost as a self-portrait — an Oxonian poet and novelist, already acclaimed in the West and Anglophone India, Amit is superlatively sympathetic. The most illustrative line about him is a massive spoiler, so I've put it at the bottom [here](#Chatterji)

*A Suitable Boy* is only slightly an economic novel, but it is an economical one. Seth's aversion to adverbs is second only to Stephen King's. When he does deploy them, it's done mockingly.

> The talkative [guppi] was asking Maan about his love life, and Maan was attempting weakly to fend off the questions. "People's love lives are not very interesting," said Maan, sounding unconvincing even to himself. 
>  
> "How can you say that?" said the guppi. "Every man's love life is interesting. If he doesn't have one, that's interesting. If he has one, that's interesting. And if he has two, that's twice as interesting." He laughed delightedly at his sally.

Twelfth Night; Amit's Shakespeare opinions on compression

the version in the book, "Indian-movie-style, concluded with the last of four songs."

> Sometimes, sitting here, with the marked script of Twelfth Night open on her lap, Lata substituted the word "happiness" for "greatness" in the famous quotation. She wondered what one could do to be born happy, to achieve happiness, or to have it thrust on one. The baby, she thought, had arranged to be born happy; she was placid, and had as good a chance as anyone of happiness in this world, her father's poor health notwithstanding.

Biography of Nehru

I'll throw in a long section, my favorite, to conclude.

> Amit, needless to say, was disappointed, but not as much as he might have been. His novel, now that he was free from the worry of handling the Chatterji fortunes, was going well, and many more momentous events were taking place on his pages than in his life. He sank deeper into the novel, and — a little disgusted with himself for doing so — used his disappointment and sadness to portray that of a character who happened to be conveniently on hand. [...] Perhaps Lata had known that of the three men courting her, the only one who could be rejected without the loss of his friendship was Amit.
