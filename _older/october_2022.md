## Reading 

I've done less re-reading of fiction this year than I usually do. In fact, I've been positively smug about how much new fiction I've exposed myself to this year.{% sidenote "nobel" "I'm writing this a few days after the Ernaux win (I lost about £30 on the betting markets, I had money on Murnane and Edna O’Brien). I'd never heard of Ernaux before reading through the contenders sheet last week; I doubt I'll read her but only because I have an inexplicable aversion to autofiction. " %} Earlier this month, however, I returned to one of my old favorites, Vikram Seth's *A Suitable Boy*. Seth wrote the book{% sidenote "tome" "I read it on kindle the first time, and was astounded to see the size of a hard copy, more than 1,100 pages!

the version in the book, "Indian-movie-style, concluded with the last of four songs."

> Sometimes, sitting here, with the marked script of Twelfth Night open on her lap, Lata substituted the word "happiness" for "greatness" in the famous quotation. She wondered what one could do to be born happy, to achieve happiness, or to have it thrust on one. The baby, she thought, had arranged to be born happy; she was placid, and had as good a chance as anyone of happiness in this world, her father's poor health notwithstanding.

Biography of Nehru

I'll throw in a long section, my favorite, to conclude. 

The actual question: which team are you on? In my memory, before beginning my re-read, 

Reputations; Alice in Wonderland; Stories of Your Life
