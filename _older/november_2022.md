## November, 2022



My two smaller classes, microeconomics taught by [Inés Moreno de Barreda](https://sites.google.com/site/inesmorenodebarreda/) and econometrics taught by [Anders Bredahl Kock](https://sites.google.com/site/andersbkock/), each meet twice a week in Seminar Room C of the Manor Road Building.{% marginfigure "mrb" "assets/img/mrb.jpg" "The website manchesterhistory.net inexplicably has a page with the most complete history of the MRB, completed in 2004, including quotes from the architects proposal: ''the colouring and 'natural' finish of the concrete also compliment the natural sandstone of Oxford's historic buildings.'' I can't decide if this would be funnier if it were sarcasm or straight. " %} There are many unkind things I could say about the MRB, but the shortcoming which has the most impact on my wellbeing is the utter absence of light — none of the seven classrooms/seminar rooms, nor the Large Lecture Theatre, have windows. This leads to a discomfiting experience, presumably shared by everyone north of the 52nd parallel{% sidenote "latox" "A latitude Oxford shares with such academic powerhouses as Kiska, Alaska; Belle Isle, Newfoundland; Lake Baikal, Russia; and Heilongjiang, the northernmost province of China." %} in November: walking into a lecture at 2:30pm, and walking out an hour later to a sky past dusk and heading for twilight.  

It seems that Seminar Room is almost exclusively dedicated to the edification of first year economics grad students. Economics shares the MRB with the sociology, criminology, IR, and chemistry{% sidenote "idkw" "Yeah, idk either." %} departments, but I have yet to see any Mearshimer-esque power flow diagrams or organic molecules left over on the rotating, lazy-Susan style whiteboards. In fact, I haven't seen anything non-econometric or microeconomic at all, besides a lazy yet eloquent diagram of Melissa Dell's "most well-known and important paper,"{% sidenote "darac" "In Daron Acemoglu's words." %} on the persistent effect of colonial mining institutions in Peru.{% sidenote "lazydia" "A line with 'mita' and 'no mita' on either side, and little people with smily faces and frowny faces on the appropriate, respective sides." %} Rather, whenever we micro&metrical students sit down to [Inés'](https://sites.google.com/site/inesmorenodebarreda/) lectures on mechanism design, [Anders'](https://sites.google.com/site/andersbkock/) scrawled exponential families and iterated integrals are all that form the borders for her [normal form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal-form_game) matrices.

Once, as Anders revolved the whiteboards in search of a clean space to draw some geometric proof of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma, he came across a series of calculations on the other side of the lazy Susan. Recoiling, Anders asked if we knew who else had been writing on his board. When we told him that Inés had been demonstrating a result in mechanism design, Anders, wielding an eraser with superlative disdain, wiped away a set of posteriors and told us that, while "Bayesians may be people, too," he wouldn't have any of them in *his* classroom. 

I couldn't decide whether to [include](https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=4127) a [comic](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/basenana) skewering [Bayesians](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/blood-of-the-bayesian) here, but as Inés wasn't there to defend her field's Weltanschauung, it's only fair to counter with Randall Munroe:

<br>

{% maincolumn "assets/img/bayes.png" "" %}

While metrics has been the most educational course,{% sidenote "oslcon" "Who knew that proving the simple consistency of ordinary least squares could be such a pain in the butt" %}  game theory and mechanism design have been the most fun. And relevant — Inés was covering incentive compatible mechanisms in the days leading up to my sisters' stress over Taylor Swift tickets. TicketMaster was facing a much larger scale version of the simplistic problem we covered in class. What we covered in class has little relevance to the TicketMaster debacle, for boring reasons I'll put in a sidenote,{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "We spent most of our time with transfereable utilities, and in this setting, for an allocation rule to be implementable, it has to be increasing. That is, the probability of someone getting a good has to increase as their willingness and ability to pay for that good increases. This is exactly what causes all of the chaos for artists like Swift — they *don't* want the ability to pay to be the deciding factor in who sees their shows. But most of the efficiency concepts we learn in first year micro depend on this assumption." %} but ask me next term if I have any insight — we'll have *the* Paul Klemperer covering auctions.{% sidenote "multg" "Including multi-good auction, which can be made to resemble this sort of dynamic pricing pretty simply. I think. " %}

One solution to the Taylor Swift ticket debacle my dad suggested was basing access off of Spotify data — anyone who, like my sister Olivia, has had "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)" on repeat since last November gets first crack at tickets. This would be incentive compatible, but my first thought was how easy it is to game, by leaving Spotify on muted repeat overnight. 

I got screwed by an accidental version of this strategy in 2021. It's winter, which means building anticipation for the unveiling of one's Spotify Wrapped. Last December, I was shocked, shocked! to find my top song of 2021 was "Daisies" by Katy Perry. It took me a week to figure out what had happened: while visiting Bethesda in the summer, I had volunteered to drive the occasional ambulance at my old fire station. One afternoon, I was writing Stata code on my laptop in the ready lounge, cycling through mindless pop, when my ambulance was called out for a long, boring medical emergency of some sort. Instead of pausing my Spotify, I had put the current song on repeat, that song being: "Daisies," by Katy Perry. When we returned from Suburban Hospital 3+ hours later, that little ditty had played enough times to bump to the top of my personal charts.

I don't know what's going to top my Wrapped next month, but you can bet you'll read about it here. 

This month's update will be a bit shorter than planned for reasons explained in a miffed sidenote.{% sidenote "yeargh" "i just spent three hours wrestling with a bug in my github logs preventing me from building this page, only to find out that what i thought was the bug was actually a completely different bug and the bug i was wrestling with is actually not a bug and totally unimportant and the actual bug could be fixed by checking a box on github which i would have known to do if the company which i pay to host my website had *just sent me an email* and i'm reminded yet again why i am not a programmer. netlify deprecated xenial, which i preferred on kabbalistic grounds, in favor of the ubuntu focal build image, which immediately froze all builds. yeargh." %} The upside is that I cut out three book reviews and two album reviews to get this out by the end of the month, so those will come at New Years.

From about 2007 to 2012, I read exclusively *Star Wars* books.

### What the heck is weather? 

I say a lot of things about weather in a given day, usually starting with muttered irritation when I sit up in bed and look out my window to see how wet my bike seat has gotten overnight.{% sidenote "wetsasd" "True to form, I don't use this information in any way except to steel myself for a wet butt." %} The English skill and enthusiasm for weather-based conversation is well-known, but less discussed is the infectiousness of meteorological chit-chat. An older English lady with whom I volunteer remarked how "lucky we are to live in a country with such varied weather! Imagine if we were in a country where it was hot everyday — what would people talk about?" My friends who moved to Oxford from stabler climes confirm this impression — and in Sierra Leone, there was hardly a comment about the weather, even when the harmattan{% sidenote "harmat" "The Sahara's annual dust fart over coastal west Africa." %} was especially caustic.

The adopted enthusiasm for gossip about the wind and rain and darkness, unfortunately, doesn't come with any meteorological crash courses. I have found myself saying things like, "Feels like a cold front coming in,"{% sidenote "colf" "This is what I say when I mean 'I think it's going to rain for a few hours, then get colder.'" %}  or, "I think this squall line will hang out for a couple hours,"{% sidenote "sqal" "Or, 'I think we'll get some on-and-off heavy rain for a while, with some thunder if we're lucky.'" %}  with no sense of whether words mean anything. To up my chit-chat game, I borrowed five top-rated meteorology textbooks and figure out how to say more interesting things about the wind and rain. The goal was to end up in this situation, plus a bit of tact: 

<br>

This won't be much of a problem — meteorology textbooks seem to fall into two categories, neither of which actually teach you about the weather.

### Monthly Le Guin

*Another Story, or A Fisherman of the Inland Sea* is more Ursula Le Guin than Ursula Le Guin. There is a novel set of gender and sexual relations,{% sidenote "fishgend" "Describe, and include ''One's [moiety] is as deeply and intimately part of oneself as one's gender, and has quite as much to do with one's sexual life.''" %} a long voyage from home to an alien world, plenty of FTL travel and communication, an appropriate appropriated mythology, and a train. 2022 has been a very successful year for me, but I vastly underestimated the scale of one of my goals: reading everything published by Ursula Le Guin this year; I was happy to just finish the Earthsea and Hainish books. Even beyond her dozens of novels, tho, there are dozens of short stories scattered about. I found *A Fisherman* in a recently released collection, "The Found and the Lost."

*A Fisherman*, part of her Hainish universe, is notable for extended references to "historical" earth culture. The protagonist's mother left earth millenia before settling on the planet O and starting the action, and tells stories from Japanese mythology about demon rats and Momotarō, the peach boy.{% sidenote "tarou" "The titular *Fisherman* is Urashima Tarō." %} Le Guin rarely steals mythology so directly, preferring to tweak and adapt real tradition into science fiction, as in *Vaster than Empires and More Slow* or *Semley's Necklace*.

Written in 1994, *A Fisherman* is very early solarpunk, possibly unintentional solarpunk.{% sidenote "dispo" "I occasionally see Le Guin's *The Dispossessed* described as one of the first solarpunk novels, which invariably bums me out about both the novel and the genre. Both do better without the other." %} Le Guin isn't cheerful enough to thrive in as optimistic a genre as solarpunk,{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "Ask me for my opinion on *The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas* sometime" %} but her description on village life on O rivals my favorite solarpunk setting.{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "*A Prayer for the Crown-Shy*, to be written about... eventually." %} Pure Le Guin, her solarpunk is academic and industrious:

> Koneko was wanted at home because of her excellence in the discipline we call "thick planning" — farm management is the usual translation, but the words have no hint of the complexity of factors involve din thick planning, ecology politics profit tradition aesthetics honor and spirit{% sidenote "extens" "Lack of punctuation Le Guin's — her switch to the semantic extensional definition is *so cool*. " %}  all function in an intensely practical and practically invisible balance of preservation and renewal, like the homeostasis of a vigorous organism. 

I won't read every word by Le Guin in 2022; my success with Orwell/Blair last year made me overconfident! But I'm very glad to have unread Le Guin waiting for me in 2023. 

## Listening

Here's a review of Taylor Swift's *Reputation*, inspired by a) a now-deleted Caroline Ellison Tumblr post, and b) my sisters both demanding a review of *Midnights*.

Two excellent hard bop albums, one old, one new. 

*Hub Cap*, from Freddie Hubbard and co.{% sidenote "hubcol" "Including some pretty famous names, Jimmy Heath and Julian Priester" %} 
Looking around for reviews, I found a review in *The Guardian* of the CD reissue in 2003,{% sidenote "cdrev" "This seems a common phenomena — reissues allow critics an excuse to write about albums they missed by vice of being in middle school at the time of the original release." %} which seemed to just be an excuse for [John Fordham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fordham_(jazz_critic)) to use phrases like "dry loquacity" and "hell-for-leather attack".  

How can instrumental music be camp? Sontag's extensional list{% sidenote "zulei" "Beginning with *Zuleika Dobson*, which is the book I've most often tried and failed to write about in the past year." %} contains both *Swan Lake* and Bellini's operas{% sidenote "lupela" "Plus the Cuban singer La Lupe, but that cannot be a claim about " %}

Here is a claim about a sensibility, as Sontag called it, tho I would prefer "disposition": funk is the campiest genre of instrumental music. Here I point to two recent and two old examples. First, Pridjevi's 2021 album Drugi Korijen. Second, dnacefloor dervish
