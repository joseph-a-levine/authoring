## November, 2022



My two smaller lectures, microeconomics and econometrics, each meet twice a week in Seminar Room C of the Manor Road Building.{% marginfigure "mrb" "assets/img/mrb.jpg" "The website manchesterhistory.net inexplicably has a page with the most complete history of the MRB, completed in 2004, including quotes from the architects proposal: ''the colouring and 'natural' finish of the concrete also compliment the natural sandstone of Oxford's historic buildings.''" %} There are many unkind things I could say about the MRB


This month's post will be a bit shorter than planned for reasons explained in a miffed sidenote.{% sidenote "yeargh" "i just spent three hours wrestling with a bug in my github logs preventing me from building this page, only to find out that what i thought was the bug was actually a completely different bug and the bug i was wrestling with is actually not a bug and totally unimportant and the actual bug could be fixed by checking a box on github which i would have known to do if the company which i pay to host my website had *just sent me an email* and i'm reminded yet again why i am not a programmer. netlify deprecated xenial, which i preferred on kabbalistic grounds, in favor of the ubuntu focal build image, which immediately froze all builds. yeargh." %} The upside is that I cut out three book reviews and two album reviews to get this out by the end of the mon

[EDIT: A friend told me the Kline translation, the source of the above quotes, is not well-regarded by classicists. I read two other translations which are notably less virtue ethics-y:  
  
There also seem to be large discrepencies in structure and implication of the   
  
Alternatively, maybe everything sounds more virtuous in prose, and all true consequentialist texts should be written in verse.]

I vastly underestimated the scale of my goal to read everything published by Ursula Le Guin this year; I was happy to just finish the Earthsea and Hainish books. But 

In 2021, I read everything published by George Orwell or Eric Blair.{% sidenote "1984ex" "Except for *1984*, out of pique. " %} 

Expressionists

Argentina

Borges himself, always consumed by infinity, returns to *Hamlet*'s recursion repeatedly. His 1939 essay "When Fiction Lies in Fiction" 
His earlier essay on "The Translators of The *Thousand and One Nights*" 
> On night 602, King Schahriah hears his own story from the queen's lips? Like the general framework, a given tale often contains within itself other tales of equal length: stages within the stage as in the tragedy of Hamlet, raised to the power of a dream.
Did Borges and Lem ever meet?

From about 2007 to 2012, I read exclusively *Star Wars* books.
I'm not sure why I never got into fan fiction — the first serious fan fiction work I ever read was *All the Young Dudes*, a Harry Potter fiction I've covered previously. 13-year-old me would have been ripe for 
In July of this year, while working on an essay about abolition, I came across a fan fiction writer

## Listening

Here's a review of Taylor Swift's *Reputation*, inspired by a) a now-deleted Caroline Ellison Tumblr post, and b) my sisters both demanding a review of *Midnights*.

Two excellent hard bop albums, one old, one new. 

*Hub Cap*, from Freddie Hubbard and co.{% sidenote "hubcol" "Including some pretty famous names, Jimmy Heath and Julian Priester" %} 
Looking around for reviews, I found a review in *The Guardian* of the CD reissue in 2003,{% sidenote "cdrev" "This seems a common phenomena — reissues allow critics an excuse to write about albums they missed by vice of being in middle school at the time of the original release." %} which seemed to just be an excuse for [John Fordham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fordham_(jazz_critic)) to use phrases like "dry loquacity" and "hell-for-leather attack".  

How can instrumental music be camp? Sontag's extensional list{% sidenote "zulei" "Beginning with *Zuleika Dobson*, which is the book I've most often tried and failed to write about in the past year." %} contains both *Swan Lake* and Bellini's operas{% sidenote "lupela" "Plus the Cuban singer La Lupe, but that cannot be a claim about " %}

Here is a claim about a sensibility, as Sontag called it, tho I would prefer "disposition": funk is the campiest genre of instrumental music. Here I point to two recent and two old examples. First, Pridjevi's 2021 album Drugi Korijen. Second, dnacefloor dervish
