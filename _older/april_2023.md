At this point, you've read much too much about LLMs. But this page is about my life, and much of my last month has been about LLMs. So deal with it.

I've probably talked more with ChatGPT in March than any individual person. When I downloaded my chat history, I've written tens of thousands of words, almost entirely about measure and social choice theory. That's way more than I've written in letters, emails, WhatsApp, or Telegram.{% sidenote "inpersd" "I might have spoken more words to some people this month than typed to ChatGPT. This is harder to count tho. Luis, Polina, and Ivan are the main contenders." %}

Despite this massive growth in words-typed-in-conversation, talking to ChatGPT has no substitution effect on my other conversations. Or rather, the conversations it replaced wouldn't have happened anyway. Last month, I wrote

> I have a crippling inability to ask stupid questions, which can leave me floundering. But ChatGPT can’t judge! I’ve taken to keeping a ChatGPT tab open in lecture alongside the slides, and asking it about points of confusion.

It's possible that exam stress would have eventually brought me to asking these questions to my friends, but more likely I would have been left with some lesser search engine, like Google. 

Unlike the most interesting examples floating around, I'm completely unable to hold a conversation with Bing. I don't think this is due to the recent handicapping, either, but a personal fault. I had access to Bing for about three days before it was hobbled, and I couldn't get it to go psychotic on me at all.{% sidenote "bingho-id" "Almost disappointing." %} Even now, Ethan Mollick is getting highly creative [long-form content](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1640544340882644992/photo/1) from Bing,  while I struggle to provoke anything more interesting than the first few paragraphs of a wikipedia page. 

The other tool I've gotten use out of is [Poe](https://poe.com/login?redirect_url=%2F). Far less supercilious than ChatGPT, Poe has an advantage in giving information and a disadvantage in giving explanations. 

Because of that, ChatGPT remains my tool of choice. And especially since the middle of the month when I canceled dinner with three friends because "GPT-4 just dropped and I want to see if it has any thoughts about cats or consciousness," I've been relying on it more and more. 

My use case is, still, entirely learning economics. And the new model is a big improvement — ChatGPT(4) can prove things in a way ChatGPT(3.5) couldn't. But it still has flaws. In order, here are some things ChatGPT(4) is good at. 
 
1. 1. Explaining concepts. Right now, instead of writing this, I should be trying to understand 2-state Markov process for asset pricing. 
2. 2. Explaining notation. Economists are really really bad at this. We had five macro professors put five versions of the Taylor rule on the board with five sets of notation. ChatGPT has seen them all before
3. 3. Writing questions (and, less so, solutions). 
4. 4. Proving theorems. Really, this is the only one that matters. How long until we can ask ChatGPT, here's a theorem on verifiable disclosure I just came up with, can you prove it for me? Or worse{% sidenote "betprefid" "Better?" %}, how long until we can ask it to come up with a theorem, then prove it? We're not there yet — and seeing how foolish ChatGPT(4)'s proofs occassionally are, I wouldn't be surprised if the "come up with a theorem" bit is easier than the "prove it" bit.{% sidenote "ramanuj-id" "Call that 'Ramanujan mode.' Could and should write a whole post on this. " %}

Zvi Mowshowitz writes "The AI is doing a lot of pattern matching on [previously asked] questions. That means that if your question can be solved by such matching you are in good shape, if it can’t you are likely in bad shape."{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "Cf. [this tweet](https://twitter.com/cHHillee/status/1635790330854526981). But if you think the AI is 'retrieving' a 'known' answer, you're thinking about it wrong." %}

## Reading 

March was my worst reading month since I've kept data. I didn't read much, and what I did read, I didn't like. Usually, I'm much better at abandoning books early on, but failed completely last month. I'll put the dislikes in a sidenote;{% sidenote "dislmuob-id" "•*How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe*, by Charles Yu (a poor man's solipsistic *Hitchiker's Guide*) •*Your Driver is Waiting*, by Priya Guns (much too rough and shallow) •*What's Our Problem*, by Tim Urban (*this* took you five years? will be a footnote on a great long-form career)" %} the strong likes are:

- •"The Written World and the Unwritten World," Essays by Italo Calvino. 
- •"Red Plenty," by Francis Spufford.
- •"The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner," by Daniel Ellsberg. I was introduced to Daniel Ellsberg by Arundhati Roy's 2016 book "Things that Can and Cannot Be Said" — Roy and Ellsberg traveled to Moscow to sit down with Edward Snowden. Roy had an idea for a great conversation between the two great American whistleblowers. That version of Ellsberg wasn't an ideologue, just a disappointed academic. Ellsberg's passion was never the Vietnam war; that was just a tragedy he was forced by conscience to interact with. Nuclear policy was his true passion. In "Things," Ellsberg asks Snowden:

{% maincolumn "assets/img/strangelove.png" "JC is John Cusack, who is also there." %}

   You get the feeling that "Doomsday Machine" is the book which Ellsberg has wanted to write for his whole life, if he hadn't been drawn in by Vietnam. This version of him *is* an ideologue; he mentions, offhand, the weeks he spent hiding from the FBI, attempting to hide, uncover, and re-hide documents about US nuclear war plans. He has devoted much of his post-Vietnam work to reducing the risk of nuclear war, with measurable success. I hope to review the book in full soon.
  
   Ellsberg will [likely die](https://original.antiwar.com/daniel-ellsberg/2023/03/02/living-on-a-deadline-in-the-nuclear-age-some-personal-news-from-daniel-ellsberg/) this year. 
  
> "When I copied the Pentagon Papers in 1969, I had every reason to think I would be spending the rest of my life behind bars. It was a fate I would gladly have accepted if it meant hastening the end of the Vietnam War, unlikely as that seemed (and was). Yet in the end, that action – in ways I could not have foreseen, due to Nixon’s illegal responses – did have an impact on shortening the war. In addition, thanks to Nixon’s crimes, I was spared the imprisonment I expected, and I was able to spend the last fifty years with Patricia and my family, and with you, my friends."
  
   We will miss him.

## Listening

- •This [John Clayton video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGQN8vdwVrI) is a treat. Gotta be in the top ten of artists I'd like to see live.
- •I listened to three recordings of the [Oberammergau Passion Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberammergau_Passion_Play), inspired by [this article](https://www.plough.com/en/topics/culture/literature/oberammergaus-broken-vow). The passion play is performed as repayment for a vow made by the villagers of Oberammergau in 1633 to save them from the plague and the Thirty Years War; in return for their salvation, they perform the five+ hour passion all summer in the decadal year. The overture is especially stunning. For reasons separate from the author of the above article, I found the 2022 performance underwhelming; I most recommend the [2010 recording](https://www.discogs.com/release/11843021-Solisten-Chor-Und-Orchester-Der-Passionsspiele-Oberammergau-Rochus-Dedler-Markus-Zwink-Passionsspiel). I didn't expect supersessionism to take such a large role.
- •RAYE has a superb debut/comeback album out, *[My 21st Century Blues](https://open.spotify.com/album/3U8n8LzBx2o9gYXvvNq4uH?si=AA_EU9-wT0eWAIavU-CfLg)*, positively [reviewed](https://www.ft.com/content/707dedeb-fb5a-4ad0-8c62-e2aece4d6339) in the FT. Unlike her massive, polished 2010s hits with the likes of David Guetta and Jonas Blue, the new album is old-fashioned and R&B and gritty and retro pop and addictive.
