A Mostly Useless Historical Case Study

Exams finished in mid-April — I'll learn the results in July, and update here once I do. For the next eight weeks, I'd prefer to think about _anything_ else. 

Oxfordshire has been obliging. For most of week one of Trinity Term, the sun has come out and the weather has tended warm. I've exploited my sudden free time and the weather with lots of time outside. Mostly river outings, but on April's last Wednesday, I took a day trip to Averbury and Silbury, a neolithic site 45 miles south of Oxford. For any tourists visiting the south of England, I recommend replacing the mandatory Stonehenge stop with the Avebury World Heritage site. It dominates stonehenge on every metric — Avebury is older, larger, less crowded, and more important to our understanding of neolithic people. And — there is a town *inside* of the stone circle:

While Avebury is less well-preserved,{% sidenote "fewersta-id" "Fewer of the original stones are still standing." %} this is because Stonehenge is a *fraud.* 

Two kilometers south of Avebury is Silbury. If Avebury is a mysterious, interlocking and overlapping, convoluted complex of stone circles set to align to some unknown astronomical phenomenon, Silbury is... a massive old pile of dirt. To be fair, it is the massivest, oldest pile of dirt in England, but it is just a big mound of dirt. 

Silbury hill was built about 4,500 years ago, almost contemporaneously with the pyramids of Giza, and of comparable volume. While we don't know the hill's purpose, of course there is plenty of speculation. More interesting than "why," however, is the labor cost. [Atkinson (1974)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/74279) wrote that it would have taken 500 men 15 years to build Silbury hill: 

> In view of the small size of the neolithic population, this represents a fraction of the 'gross national product' at least as great as that currently devoted by the United States of America to the whole of its space programme. 

This is even more striking given the (supposed) subsistence-level existence of neolithic Brits, challenging our assumptions and estimates of neolithic land productivity. If such a large fraction of the population could have been supported in non-productive{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "This is a random sidenote" %} labor for an extended period, the rest of the economy must have been well above subsistence. This remains true if the Silbury laborers were enslaved. 

Further, our assumptions about the ability of neolithic societies to project power. Leaving aside the geographic dispersion of these sites — the outer stones at Stonehenge traveled from Wales{% sidenote "stonehswa-id" "Wales! This is my trump mind-blowing Stonehenge fact. The stones were brought more than 150 miles, at a time when the wheel was dubious. Or — they were brought almost *200* miles by sea, when the canoe was the height of seaworthiness. Everything about the past was so weird and we have [no idea](https://xkcd.com/1747/)." %} — there is something unexpected about the dedication and perseverence of the contemporary power structure's dedication to these stone structures. Return to Atkinson's analogy to the space program: in the US, we can't hold a space policy for more than a presidential administration. The current Artemis program, surviving from Trump to Biden, is the **first** new human NASA initiative to survive a presidential transition since the 1980s. Sure, neolithic Brits didn't have to put up with pesky elections, but think of the consistent draw on resources of a project, drawn out over decades, which has no tangible, merely spiritual, benefits.
At that point, the dedication of this society becomes near fanatic.

I"m not someone who sat down and listened to The Beatles when I was a kid; there was rarely music playing in my house growing up, and I was too busy developing my own quirky taste in the early 2010s to 

But I've probably heard 90% of Beatles songs in my life? Scrolling through [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_the_Beatles), there are dozens of titles I don't recognize, mostly from Help! and The White Album, 

So it shocks me that, consistently, every few months, I hear a Beatles song for the "first time" and get immediately swept up. Last summer, it was "Got to Get You Into My Life," in December, "She Came In Through The Bathroom Window," last week, "I've Just Seen a Face."
