## Updates

I'm in DC for all of April; please say hi! The rest of my year is coming together: 
**May**: Oxford for Trinity term, UK baseball national championships, meetings with funders
**June**: Oxford (Summer VIIIs, end of the school year) to Alaska for LB's wedding
**July**: Up for grabs; probably a trip to West Africa
**August**: Bay Area for a summer school
**September**: 
**October**: Back to Oxford for the new school year
**November**: 
**December**: Still up in the air, but a few ambitious trips are being conceived. I'm hoping to meet a penguin. 

A lot of the above depends on My Wonderful Girlfriend's doings. She is constantly motivating me to be more ambitious with all of the pots she keeps on the fire. I've been applying to more things — fellowships, summer schools, research grants — because of her 

The only new post on my blog tab was at the beginning of last month, on labor and AI. I've been developing some research ideas on this topic with LH 
Otherwise, I drafted some goofy posts on inflation in the star wars universe and 



## Reading

I've been coming up against a problem for this section recently: all of the book reviews and paper reviews I start writing feel like they deserve their own posts. Here are a few "Reading" sections I've started recently, which then moved to my drafts section: 

> • Books and papers I read when I want to believe in the EMH less
> • Monetary policy and fixed income securities in the Star Wars universe 
> • Reading with AI *only* works if the book is in context (contra [Cowen and Perrell](https://howiwrite.substack.com/p/tyler-cowen-will-ai-kill-writing))

Maybe some of these will end up on my blog tab in the next month!

One thing that does fit nicely here is this [*monster* profile of William Vollmann](https://www.metropolitanreview.org/p/the-last-contract). I've only read a bit of Vollmann, primarily *AFGHAN PIC*, the abridged *Rising Up and Rising Down*, and excerpts from his book on climate.

{% newthought "We found Cleo, the" %} magic integral solver. Famous for finding [elegant and unexpected](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/562694/integral-int-11-frac1x-sqrt-frac1x1-x-ln-left-frac2-x22-x1) solutions to terrifying looking integrals, Cleo was [a sockpuppet account of a well-intentioned Uzbek programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gQ9DnSYsXg). Why did he do it? 
> I was frustrated that when I posted questions about integrals on math stack exchange, I often received comments like "why is this interesting" or, "what makes you think that it might have a closed form solution?"
And he took that personally.

{% newthought "The names of all of the" %} [snowplows of Wichita](https://www.wichita.gov/DocumentCenter/View/22826/PWSnowPlowNames-PDF).

{% newthought "When Mario Vargas Llosa Punched" %} [Gabriel García Márquez](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/03/06/when-mario-vargas-llosa-punched-gabriel-garcia-marquez/). An LLM offhandedly mentioned this incident, in a conversation where it had hallucinated character and plot details of *Love in the Time of Cholera*, so I almost assumed it away. But!
> I know the truth about that fight. I’ll tell you. Look, Mario has been a great womanizer and he’s a very good-looking man. Women die for Mario. So Mario, on a trip he made by ship from Barcelona to El Callao, met a very beautiful woman. They fell in love. He left his wife and went off with her. And the marriage was over and all that. His wife went back to pack up the house and, of course, she began to see friends. Then they got back together and his wife told Vargas Llosa, “Don’t think I’m not attractive. Friends of yours like Gabo were after me … ” One day they met in a theater in Mexico City, and Gabo went toward him with open arms. Vargas Llosa made a fist and said, “For what you tried to do to my wife,” and knocked him to the ground. Then Ms. Gaba said, “What you’re saying can’t be true because my husband likes women, but only very good-looking women.”



{% newthought "A stanford undergrad's" %} [physics homework](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kovar/hall.html) from the late 90s: "Electron Band Structure In Germanium, My Ass". The conclusion: 
> Going into physics was the biggest mistake of my life. I should've declared CS. I still wouldn't have any women, but at least I'd be rolling in cash.


He is now a Staff Engineer at Google. 


{% newthought "Gwern is also good at" %} metaphors: 
> I've speculated that the effect of hyper-speed media like social media is to destroy the multi-level filtering of society, and the different niches wind up separating and becoming self-contained hermetic ecosystems. (Have you ever used a powerful stand mixer to mix batter and set it too high? What happens? Well, if the contents aren't liquid enough to flow completely at high speed, you tend to observe that your contents separate, and shear off into two or three different layers, rotating inside each other, with the inner layer spinning ultra-rapidly while the outer layer possibly becoming completely static and stuck to the sides of the mixing bowl. The inner layer is Tiktok, and the stuck outer layer is places like academia. The big fads and discoveries and trends in Tiktok spin around so rapidly and are forgotten so quickly that none of them ever 'make it out' to elsewhere.)


{% newthought "The last thing I intend to read" %} about [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto-benjamin-wallace-book-excerpt.html).We will never know and that's fine.

{% newthought "Matt Lakeman on the" %} [conquest of the Incas](https://mattlakeman.org/2025/03/24/conquest-of-the-incas/).

{% newthought "Voltaire claimed that the" %} [*Circassians* invented vaccination](https://www.atvbt.com/voltaire-on-vaccines/) because their kids had to be hot for the harems. Also, Benedictines catching strays:
> Some people maintain that the Circassians originally took this custom from the Arabs, but we leave this historical point to be cleared up by some learned Benedictine, who will doubtless compose several folio volumes on the subject, with proofs.

{% newthought "Tyler Cowen has been enormously" %} influential on me, even years after I've stopped reading Marginal Revolution; my social circle and online world sometimes feel like the Tyler Cowen Cinematic Universe. I enjoyed [this profile](https://archive.ph/u8vug#selection-1615.0-1635.39) in The Economist. 
> Cowen’s emotional life remains a mystery. He told me he did not experience regret. “I don’t know what the function of it is,” he said. “Is it to signal thoughtfulness? To stop you making further mistakes? It’s like revenge. I don’t understand it.” Cowen also said he didn’t understand envy or anger. He didn’t know what he should be envious _of_. He didn’t get lonely, by himself or in company. He actually said, “Why bother?”
>
> When he told me he had never been depressed, I asked him to clarify what he meant. He had never been clinically depressed? Depressed for a month? For a week? An afternoon? I looked up from my notebook. An enormous smile, one I’d not seen before, had spread across the whole of Cowen’s face.
> 
> “Like, for a _whole_ afternoon?” he asked, hugely grinning.


{% newthought "Reginald Foster was a" %} Vatican Latinist for 40 years and a passionate Latin teacher. He died in 2020. A [recent profile](https://newcriterion.com/article/the-vaticans-latinist/) and [this older one](https://www.carmelitaniscalzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1994-Latin-fanatic.pdf) in The American Scholar were both touching.
> And in many ways Foster’s resembles the life of a medieval saint: at the age of six, he would play priest, ripping up old sheets as vestments. He entered seminary at thirteen. He said he wanted only three things in life: to be a priest, to be a Carmelite, and to do Latin. He has spent his entire life in great personal poverty. His cell had no mattress: he slept on the tile floor with a thin blanket. His clothes were notorious in Rome: believing that the religious habit no longer reflected the simple garb of the people as it once had, he gave up his cassock and bought his clothes at Sears: blue pants and a blue shirt, with brandless black sneakers. When it was cold he added a zip-up blue polyester jacket. The Vatican’s Swiss guards called him “il benzinaio,” the gas-station attendant. Reporting for work at the Vatican, he looked like someone called to fix one of the washing-machines in the laundry room. His outfit was more like something his own father, a plumber in Milwaukee, would have worn. When people would give him gifts, he would give them to the poor. He owned almost nothing, and his Vatican office was legendarily spare: a typewriter, pens and paper, one chair, one desk, and a Latin dictionary. Nothing mattered to him except Latin.

{% newthought "Bhutan has spent half of their" %} foreign reserves on [Bitcoin mining infrastructure](https://asianews.network/bhutans-bitcoin-asset-value-crosses-usd-1b-ranks-fifth-among-countries-holding-btc/) over the past four years. Their currency is pegged to the Indian rupee, so I'm reading this as a highly-leveraged crypto position with sovereign characteristics. 

{% newthought "If you define your" %} least favorite book as: 
> All that prose talent, spent on a book about bad people doing nothing in a world the author hated. Two or three lines so beautiful they linger for me even now, trapped inside a profoundly cynical, empty book.

Then [one](https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1898892954120462470) might choose Gatsby or "[One Hunded Years of Solitude](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/monthly-roundup-28-march-2025)". I would defend Márquez, as that was what he was trying to do. Maybe Houellebecq's *Whatever*? I don't know his early biography enough to say if he hated that world even then. 

## Other art

I've been going to weekly life drawing sessions in Oxford with LT; I finished my first sketchbook in January. I am Bad at drawing, but that's not the point. Drawing makes me enjoy things more. Alice Gribbin recently wrote about [the nude](https://www.clunyjournal.com/p/do-you-want-to-see-alice-gribbin) and how it's been devalued. I found it valuable in the context of going to my first nude life drawing sessions.
> In public and private life today, a person’s primary visual encounters with imagery of the naked or semi-naked human figure are through neither art nor worship but advertising, entertainment, and porn. It’s pathetic that this is true. We choose another way.

I watched one great movie this month, *The Battle of Algiers*.

I also watched two peak Kevin Costner movies, *Bull Durham* and *No Way Out*. Both feel like 

In poetry, I read William Carlos Williams' *Spring and All* after I got to DC; it goes well with the cherry blossoms blooming. Whenever I read Williams or Whitman, I wish I could see in NYC what they saw. 

I finished working through Ted Gioia's list of 2024 albums. A few favorites from the bottom of the list: 

> • **Songs of my land**, Chiyomi Yamada and baobab
> 
> • **Echoes of Becoming**, Canberk Ulaş 
> 
> • **Riley**, Riley Mulherkar
> 
> • **Banjo Mantras**, Kendl Winter
