The graph below compares Eloundou et al.'s estimation of AI exposure (x-axis) to Anthropic's data on actual Claude usage (y-axis). Each axis measures the "percent of tasks within an occupation exposed to automation," per the two datasets. Each point represents an occupation, with size indicating the current estimate of people employed in that profession and color showing job family (both per the Bureau of Labor Statistics). Use the dropdown to focus on any particular job family.
