### Genocide and American power

Samantha Power, Noam Chomsky, and can I loop in Atahualpa?

The book that changed Aaron Schwartz's life was [] by Noam Chomsky. 

I don't think Noam Chomsky is wrong about literally everything. He is a horrible forecaster, and is very bad at identifying root causes. But his directional attention isn't always wrong. Take Cambodia — he is right there. Maybe even more right than Power.
The media stuff does seem importantly wrong. The "status" explanation is more important than the "elite capture" explanation, or rather supersedes it. But then we have to consider "culture" and what grants status in confusing times, which he refuses to do. 
I don't know. I appreciate Chomsky for his anger, but it eventually becomes too intellectual — at which point it's no longer anger, and no longer appreciated. He's also a bit too excited about having secret knowledge.

If Chomsky is the most pessimistic commentor on American power, 


### Politeness around killing

An acquaintance in Oxford does her PhD on rewilding. Her family runs a large rewilding project in Sussex, boasting thousands of hectares of land for wild cattle and boar and anything else that stops by. They host tours, camping, safari, and petting zoos. Gentlemen farmers had mostly given up on profitability in the 20th century, and not all estates can be rewilding attractions — but this one, it seems, is quite successful. 

Napoleon called England "a nation of shopkeepers," but talking to conservatives today, or a hundred years ago, it is not that commerce which people are ostalgic for. England, in its own memory, is a nation of farmers, who shape and rule their land and its bounty. Shooting, in the Victorian style, with a gameskeeper and beaters and loaders, was something wholly and synonmously associated with this England. *The Shooting Party*, a novel set in 1913 and written in the 1970s, mocks, memorializes, and mourns this bit of pastorality. Sir Randolph Nettleby, Baronet, hosts the best shoots in England at his estate five miles west of Oxford; they were a favorite of King Edward VII. 

Colegate touchingly substitutes the several hundred birds killed that day with a martyr, a duck named Elfrida Beetle{% sidenote "elfred-id" "'She used to be called Alfred and then when she turned into a female she was going to be called Alfreda but Nanny said it wasn't Alfreda but Elfreda and then she'd just swallowed a beetle and elle is French for she.'" %} adopted by the Baronet's grandson. The duck escapes on the day of the duck hunt, among the ducks to be hunted, forcing a moment of vertigo among the shooters. Even the hunters in the line, with three guns to hand, pledge they "shall not, if I can possibly help it, shoot young Osbert's duck."

The shooters do not wish to be rude by killing the child's duck. That is not, however, the focus of their politeness. The driving conflict of the story is between Lord Gilbert Hartlip ("one of the best shots in England, if not the best of all, and it was a pleasure to see him in action") and Lionel Stephens — a more fit, modern sportsman. Throughout the party and the affairs and the secrets — predictable to any fan of Wodehouse or *Downton Abbey* — the greatest tension is in these men's unsporting competition. 

The climax of the book, without any spoiler, is Sir Randolph's admonishment: "You were not shooting like a gentleman, Gilbert." Because, “A greedy shot in line is tiresome and an ideal day requires participants to be considerate about which birds they attempt to shoot.”

The second quote is not from Colegate's novel, but a more recent and puzzling book. Matthew Scully, a speechwriter for Bush the Younger and columnist at the *National Review*, thus introduces George H.W. Bush in his book *Dominion.*{% sidenote "dombo-id" "This is not the Tom Holland book, as people think when I bring it up, and unrelated to the movie of the same title and topic." %}  Bush was giving a speech to the Safari Club convention, the largest gathering of hunting enthusiasts in America, and Scully was present, riding his formidable conservative Christian credentials without anyone knowing he was writing a book condemning, widely and forcefully, our treatment of animals.{% sidenote "bushfor-id" "The former president, never a big game hunter, 'seems a man not quite comfortable with his surroundings yet determined not to offend.'" %}

Scully's case for vegetarianism is, like him, conservative, compassionate, and religious. The book is full of biblical verse and commentary, used waggingly like a formerly-homeschooled, now-atheist kid talking back to their still-evangelical parents. Scully is, tho, fully sincere. The title is from Genesis 1:28: 

> And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have **dominion** over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

Humans, he argues, remember the "subdue" part of our dominion, but not the duties of mercy and charity which come with it. Scully interleaves his investigations with moral musing.{% sidenote "inves-id" "It's too generous to label Scully an undercover reporter. He never lies, really — everyone just assumes that as a Republican, he supports big game hunting, whaling, and America's Farms. He is puzzled by this, but willing to take advantage." %} He draws you in with condemnations of hunting and whaling, and then wallops you over the head with factory farming. This is not what he intended: 

> I debated long and hard with myself about whether to include farm animals in this book. Holding off on that topic for another day would certainly spare me a lot of trouble, and maybe even gain me a wider readership (“Oh, good, at least he’s not one of those people”).

Instead, he spends more pages and pathos on the hunters, for their cruelty, certainty, but also their hypocracy and discourtesy. 

This is not to fault the chapter on factory farming: Scully does not shy away from the suffering of the pigs he visits; like Power, he cannot avoid a Holocaust reference. But his description of horrors is purposefully clinical. He does not get angry at the managers and staff of the farms. Rather, disappointed, he sees them as clueless, out of touch, and blind. 

We are all only human. Scully seems to resist throwing numbers at us, of the scale of our cruelties. He has little truck for Peter Singer, whom he (ironically) respects for bringing animal welfare to the mainstream, but abhors for what brought him there. We are all only human, and a moment of disgust will be worth much more than the number 4,000,000.{% sidenote "pigday-id" "The number of pigs killed, every day." %} Scully, echoing Sir Randolph, finds humanity's treatment of animal ungentlemanly, or at least un-manly, and therefore ungodly.


### Grrr transformers

I got really annoyed at transformers this month. 

I've used ChatGPT since it has been available. I work in a building with the Center for the Governance of AI. Nick Bostrom is there, sometimes. I'm one or two phone calls away from the authors of papers even you have heard of. My girlfriend does AI governance stuff. And yet my curiosity never showed up. 

In the second year of my PhD, I took a course by Max Kasy called Applications of Machine Learning, or something. It was very much a "classical" machine learning course — the last week was on LLMs, and because we were running behind, that was compressed. 

My cohort-mates have mocked me for my use of ChatGPT and Claude. I used it for code, of course, but also to study, and come up with new exam questions, and clarify concepts. I don't remember thinking of these things as miracles when they showed up, and I certainly didn't start as they became more routine. 

Something happened in the past month. I started noticing the shift before GPT1o, and it wasn't quite in the direction you'd expect. People were noticing GPT-5 was "late", and talking about S-curves. 

I broke, this past weekend, and decided to figure out what was going on under the hood. We've heard so much about transformers; what are they? What are the mechanics that create this alien thing? 

I started with [[Neel Nanda]]'s 'build gpt-2' tutorial, and it's taken me 5 hours so far, and i'm about halfway done. But it does what it says on the tin: I am acutally building GPT2. 

Yesterday, I had no idea what went into a transformer and what came out. I had no idea what happened inside. Now I can at least use the words. And boy are there a lot of words. 

got in [[The Cyberiad]] again. and [[Gwern]] beat me to it [link](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YsFZF3K9tuzbfrLxo/counting-arguments-provide-no-evidence-for-ai-doom?commentId=TvBAwgCK3dMyC9eoa)
eh did the poem test.


### Shorts

- Chronicle of a death foretold, see notes

- Making my way through [[John Milton]]'s [[Samson Agonistes]]. I'm connecting more to it than I did [[Paradise Lost]], and more, I think, than any [[Shakespeare]] i've come across lately. I need at least two more re-reads of it though. Milton remains impressive.

- Also reading Jia Tolentino's essays. She's very millenial.The first essay is on very very early internet culture, which she thrived in. HOw would I be different if i wrote 500 words a day starting when I was eight? The next essay is tons of fun, but mostly pointless, about her time on a reality show as a teenager. Then a few feminism essays — she wrote this book at the height of MeToo and just after the 2016 election. She is right, and not even annoying about it. An excellent cultural critic too. But definitely too into drugs for my aesthetic taste. 

The two essays i ahve left: one on "difficult women", and one on deciding to marry her partner of a decade (she did). 

Apparently this[review](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n02/lauren-oyler/ha-ha!-ha-ha) "generated so much attention the LRB website went down" or something. i'll read tomorrow.

In the essay on difficult women, she brings up [[Samson Agonistes]] and specifically milton's version. 

I finished Jia Tolentino's book last night. The final essay was on why she didn't want to marry her partner of a decade, with whom she has two children. If anything, it's just a constant reminder that mind-space is big. 

I also read the deeply critical essay on the book in the LRB (see yesterday). If you accept this is a memoir (which it was? obviously) then that's all fine. 

Tolentino gets by on massive amounts of social energy and writing talent. Maybe she's smart , too, but that doesn't show through. There are no great, novel insights. 


- A book i probably wont read, becuase [this](https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/review-spies-in-congo.pdf) from [[CIA]] is an excellent review. on the uranium ore in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and the efforts duing [[WWII]] to get it. the spies in the congo. really good review. history is big.

- Two days ago, I finished "The Silent Library", or some other equally inane title. It was a modern morality tale, with an over constructed and under explained magic/unreality system. A superheroine commits suicide ("My therapist says it's not clinical depression, it's situational. I just have a lot of situations.") because she had a bad day (cat died, got fired, neglected her student, got told to piss off by her best friend and neighbor). BUT! She's special and gets to decied to turn back any of her poor decisions. She can slide between lives. There is either a serious misunderstanding of talent (I think it's this one) or this book takes the many-worlds interpretation seriously. There are easily accessible worlds (which she discusses before dying!) where she is a Michael Phelps-level retired swimmer, where she is a Hayley Williams-level rock star, where she's a professor of philosophy at Cambridge. That's just not how skill is distributed. BUT, besides the nitpick, I didn't really mind the book too much. I ended up skimming quickly by the end, as it became clearer and clearer that she would get everything she wanted. There's no lesson in here, despite being constructed around one. Or if there is a lesson, it's "extrapolated volition", or whatever.

Last month...More considerations on why the [[Industrial Revolution]] didn't happen earlier, this time from [[Branko Milanovic]] [link](https://glineq.blogspot.com/2016/05/economic-reflections-on-fall-of.html). This time on [[Byzantium]]. dismissively: "Why did not there develop “bourgeois virtue”, “inclusive institutions”, Landes’ “culture”?  Or does it all have to do with “serendipity” of having coal and expensive labor in one place?"

> I do not know why market economy with wage labor failed to develop there and can only speculate that it might have been because of a militarized bureaucracy, land magnates (and thus high inequality), obsession with Christian theology which sucked the best minds into sterile disputes (it would be nice to have an anti-Christian like Gibbon tell us why the Eastern Empire could not become a capitalistic power!), its frequent wars with Arabs, Persians, Russians, Normans, Bulgars, Pechinegs, Avars, Ottomans… Any other candidates?

https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/something-interesting-is-happening
This is a crazy article (I have no desire to move to Tulsa). but the fundamental message of “Move to Tulsa and you are guaranteed a job, a nice house, a fun social life, and assistance fulfilling whichever dreams you have” is a hard one to pass up.


[[malaria]] is only transmitted via the *anopheles* genus of [[mosquito]], while *aedes* does everything else (yellow fever, chikagunya, nile fever, Zika, Dengue). But while anopheles very appropriately comes from the [[Latin]] for "useless", aedes comes from the latin for temple/shrine. This is actually just my being shit at [[etymology]] because aedes in greek means "unpleasant" or "odious." No one uses Latin for technical names.



Screeshots from thsi tyler interview were going around. [[Tyler Cowen]]'s points on [[Noam Chomsky]] go deeper than the screenshot that was shared.

search for: synthesis. Luise W. pointed me to this too. 
also this kid is an undergrad. crazy well-read
