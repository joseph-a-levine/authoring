## February, 2023

I'm back in Oxford! The first three weeks of Hilary Term{% sidenote "wint-id" "Oxford being special again, this is just 'early-winter-term,' or 'Lent' if you go to Cambridge." %} have been a blur. In Macro, Andrea Ferrero is teaching us all about monetary economics. I find the methods interesting, the topics much less so. Dr. Ferrero presented one case study of the 1724 French devaluation of the Livre — which resulted in a 30% contraction in industrial production. This demonstrates some real effects of monetary policy, but some quick maths demonstrates an even simpler lesson: don't give 14-year-old Bourbons control of your monetary policy. 

Micro and Metrics continue to hold most of my attention; 

Choice quotes from lectures, included either for nice wordsmithing{% sidenote "iamter-id" "Meg Meyer (presumably, unintentionally) presented two slides on cheap talk in  almost perfect iambic tetrameter. " %} or absurdity.

- "Bayesians are people, too"
- "Classical dichotomy"
- "Being logistic keeps you in an exponential family"
- "You've been visited by the Calvo fairy! Time to change your prices"
- "make as large a decision as possible"
- 
- "Workhorse model of sticky prices"


In week 1, I spent a few hours reading old Masters' theses in the Social Sciences Library; as I'll have to write one of these next year, I figured 

The first half of January was spent 2km above sea level.{% sidenote "denvspa-id" "All this time at altitude reminded me of one of my first consulting projects, for the Colorado Air and Space Port. At 5,500 feet above sea level, their slogan was: 'Launch Colorado: The First Mile Is Free." %} Mexico City was a blast; the city is cheap enough and comfortable

There's a U-shaped{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "This is a random sidenote" %} relationship for cities between cheapness and desireability for expats. Freetown, Sierra Leone is *cheap* cheap — but no amount of money will let you live at US levels of comfort. In a city of a million people, there can't be more than fifty dishwashers (and half of those will be in the US Embassy). 

I have no travel plans in February, besides a couple short trips to London. A few friends{% sidenote "ivivsfr" "Polina, Andy, looking forward to seeing you." %} are coming to visit, which is a good opportunity to practice tourguiding Oxford. 

Some housekeeping: there's no page for "January, 2023," as two people pointed out it makes more sense to name these updates for the month after they're posted (as that's when you'll be reading them). No change other than naming convention.

Also, longer thoughts on books, restaurants, research, etc. have been moved to the "blog" tab at the top. This page will be a bit more list-y.

## Listening

- -*The Abduction from the Seraglio*, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt. A very energetic recording. I don't have the patience to listen to opera straight through (even *Hamilton* took me three sessions my first listen through). This recording sounds stately & classical{% sidenote "clashar-id" "In some non-ironic sense." %} without dragging. If only my attention span could hold up to operatic standards.
