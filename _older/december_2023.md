## Updates 

It doesn't snow in Oxford. I mean, I'm sure it does sometimes, I've seen the postcards, but this is my third winter here and I would be surprised.

A high-pressure front

Related to what [I wrote about last month](https://jablevine.com/older/november_2023#reading): my dad texted me last week, asking if I knew what was [going on in Sierra Leone](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-67558078). No, I don't, and any analysis will probably age badly.{% sidenote "afghnote-id" "Further reminding me of [this old post on Afghanistan](https://jablevine.com/older/september_2021) which aged not all." %} We never really got closure on [July coup plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Sierra_Leone_coup_plot);

Zooming out, I'm skeptical of any insight I feel to have about this situation, and you should be too.{% sidenote "wagn-id" "To answer another question, I would be surprised if the Russians had anything to do with this. They wouldn't mind the chaos, of course, but it's out of Wagner's way, for a pretty minimal reward." %} [Timothy Garton Ash](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1997/08/14/the-curse-and-blessing-of-south-africa/) provides a good metric for this sort of analysis:

> If you want to judge anything written by a foreigner about a country, you need to know when the writer first went there. Was it in the bad old days? Or perhaps for him they were the good old days? Was it before the revolution, war, coup, occupation, liberation or whatever the local caesura is? Of course the writer’s own previous background and current politics are important too. But so often the first encounter is formative. Emotionally and implicitly, if not intellectually and explicitly, it remains the standard by which all subsequent developments are judged.

I spent 13 months in Sierra Leone; my only interactions with the national government were at customs and army checkpoints. The Covid years, late 2020 into 2021, were when the  national government flexed its state capacity for the first time since the reconstruction period. The lockdowns and curfews were enforced by the army; Bio's motorcade reportedly doubled in length; vaccines were transported in armed convoys. None of this felt particularly authoritarian — Sierra Leone{% sidenote "greeber-id" "And the US." %} has put a lot of effort into having an effective military, it makes sense to rely on it. I didn't observe an election while I was there, but both the major parties — Bio's SLPP and the opposition APC — were everpresent on the streets of Freetown. The presidential election this past summer — reelecting Bio — was contested. I, again, have no particular insight into this but my instinct is that even if the election wasn't fair, it was probably free. 

We have some other good elections coming up this year. The big one, of course, is the DRC general on 20 December. Last year, it looked like the opposition candidate — Martin Fayulu — had a chance to unseat President Tshisekedi, but the resurgent conflict in the Kivus makes me less optimistic. 










## Reading

### Complaining about papers

This is actually a re-hash of an [old complaint](https://jablevine.com/articles/23/ambulances-and-research), but it's a [new paper](https://web.stanford.edu/~chand04/papers/va_nonva_paper.pdf). David Chan, David Card, and Lowell Taylor (hence CCT) ask if there's a VA advantage — and find persistent benefits. HERE IS HWERE SIDENOTE SCHOOLS?

I don't have much of a problem with this paper





### Should I care about the intelligence of the animals I eat

> The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? 
> 
Jeremy Bentham, *Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation*

Not separate from suffering, but above it — is it worse to torture, kill, and eat an intelligent than unintelligent animal? Many of my friends are v*gan; have worked at organizations promoting [animal welfare](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/) or started [websites](https://www.animalwelfarelibrary.org/). I eat meat. I also read a lot about non-human animals and how our society interacts with them. This isn't about that, but rather about animals most of us don't — currently — eat.{% sidenote "doeat-id" "Of course, we do eat intelligent animals. Pigs  solve mazes, pass mirror tests, vocalize, engage in complex play. " %}

Any list of the smartest animal would include great apes, elephants, some parrots, octopuses, maybe dolphins. This month, I read books about baboons, octopuses, and elephants.{% sidenote "banb-id" "The book about baboons — which are not great apes — was an accident, I read about octopuses largely for this purpose, and the essay and two books about elephants were prompted by MWG." %} I don't plan to change my eating habits because of these books — I wouldn't have eaten any of these species before, and still won't — but I did prod my intuition about how factors into my moral patience.

Humans do eat **primates**. It's now well-agreed that AIDS originated from bush meat, almost certainly from a chimpanzee, hunted and consumed in the Congo, soon before 1921.{% sidenote "orig-id" "Jacques Pépin's *The Origins of AIDS* is the scientific and legible history. I read it in 2020 and have returned to certain chapters for various reasons. The final chapter, *Assembling the puzzle*, tells the full story clearly. " %} But it is becoming rarer, which I attribute to unavoidable  and logical anthropomorphization. 

Humans do eat **elephants**. The elephant Orwell [shot](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/shooting-an-elephant/) was eaten: "Burmans were bringing dash and baskets even before I left, and I was told they had stripped his body almost to the bones by the afternoon." Eating elephants has never been common,{% sidenote "djjljdel-id" "Except for geologically brief eras during the human migration out of Africa, with various Proboscidea." %} and is becoming rarer, due to effective conservation among dwindling populations. 

My elephant spree started with Caitrin Keiper's massive "[Do Elephants Have Souls?](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/do-elephants-have-souls)" in The New Atlantis. Many of the epigraphs scattered throughout were drawn from Lyall Watson's *Elephantoms*. Watson was a South African zoologist; an excellent writer, but wholly too credible.{% sidenote "whbel-id" "The most fantastic moment in his book, which Keiper ended her essay with, was when 'the last remaining Knysna elephant' apparently has a conversation with a blue whale. I'm willing to accept nature is weird and animals are capable of much more than we imagine but the circumstances are much weirder than my short summary suggests and seriously come on dude." %} He is a great enough writer to make the book worth our time. 

Humans do eat **octopuses**. They are the worst off. It has always been difficult to catch and preserve octopuses, but technology is [making life easier for us and harder for them](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64814781).











## Music

While I read a lot more when I don't have wifi, I listen to a lot less new music. The only shockingly good new thing I heard was Betty Benedeadly's "At the Institute of Mentalphysics." Weird and fun.
