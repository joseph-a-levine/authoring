## Updates

I'm writing this from San Francisco; by the time you read it, I'll be in Oxford. I've had a lovely month exploring the Bay Area, from Mill Valley to Palo Alto; Land's End to the Chabot Space Center. My wonderful girlfriend sent me a list of her 11 favorite ice cream spots before I arrived. In the end, we only got to seven. But we also visited five which were not even on that list. I also had lots of dumplings and four Mission burritos.{% sidenote "cegl-id" "Previously, my only reference for SF burritos is [Ceglowski](https://idlewords.com/2007/04/the_alameda_weehawken_burrito_tunnel.htm)." %} 

We stayed in the Inner Sunset; I have a lovely N Judah tote bag to show for it. But we also spent a lot of time in the East Bay, especially around Berkeley. 
Ted Miguel my grand-supervisor{% sidenote "gradsup-id" "This is a random sidenote" %} 
Jonathan Weigel, one of the two economists who convinced me that the DRC is the most interesting spot to be working right now.{% sidenote "tors-id" "The other being Raúl Sanchez de la Sierra, who will be visiting Oxford later this term." %} 

I also got a lot of time with Berkeley grad students, include several who are currently on the job market.  

There are three new posts on my blog this month: a history of Berkeley; a list of questions I have about San Francisco; and a semi-satirical piece on the proposal to build a Freedom City in the Presidio. Apparently I'm inspired to write by place. Many are the blogs which have died on the "I'm planning to post more in the coming months" hill; here I stake my flag on that hill, and we'll see how February goes. 


## Reading

I spent one day working at the [Mechanics' Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics%27_Institute,_San_Francisco) library with MJ. It's a very pleasant library with an excellent location; if I were into chess, I would definitely have spent more time there! While there, I went through my [Amazon list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3AR981U16OKZ0/ref=nav_wishlist_lists_3) of books I can't find elsewhere and grabbed some off their shelves. Most valuable was the complete collection of Paris Review interviews; I read the entirety of the Borges, Jan Morris, and Murakami interviews, and most of the Márquez interview. 

Borges was spectacular. 

Three individual highlights this month. 

mechanics institute?

Tony Tulathimute or something's collection of short stories, Rejection, built around his viral [[The Feminist]]. batshit crazy book. lots of meta, lots of 4th wall. lots of miserable people who do their best to make their lives more miserable by trying to get at other people. He's also a talented writer; there were extreme moments like "week old paella" that got to me.

{% newthought "Trump is potentially going to" %} recognize Somaliland as an independent country, which it has de facto been since the 90s. Kep Opalo [argues](https://www.africanistperspective.com/p/international-recognition-for-somaliland) this might necessarily be a good thing for them: " such a development _at this time_ would very likely take away the very incentives that have set them apart from the rest of Somalia over the last 33 years." I agree but for reasons more focused on foreign aid; I wrote a brief comment [here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rPzcjdfTaDHYi7jMr/looking-into-project-2025-usaid?commentId=2Z2tpPsLyikHcqLgC). 

{% newthought "Construction Physics on a personally" %} important question: [why aren't there more A380s?](https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-is-it-so-hard-to-build-an-airport)
"Airbus, in fact, based its development of the enormous A380 on the expectation that limited airport capacity meant that airlines would have no choice but to use fewer, larger planes. (The fact that this didn’t happen, and airlines instead chose to buy thousands of smaller aircraft like the 737 MAX, apparently successfully, is something I don’t quite understand.)"

{% newthought "Gwern on a Napoleon quote" %}, and what the emperor's thoughts [imply about AI development](https://www.reddit.com/r/ControlProblem/comments/1i9qt53/comment/m95avyf/). Entertaining, but mostly implies Sam Altman is just really bad at [picking quotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ControlProblem/comments/1i9qt53/comment/m9akwq6/).

{% newthought "Also Gwern, on how the economy" %} and society will adapt to AI advancements:
"Personally, my conclusion has long been that the economy & society are _so_ rigid that most such arrangements will remain largely intact even if they are dead men walking, and the pace of AI progress is so rapid that you should basically ignore any argument of the form 'but we still have human teachers, therefore, AGI can't be real'."

And compare Tyler Cowen on the release of R1: "A big day, most of all for Africa." The most important thing I learned from R1 is that a model *or better* of this quality will always be available to everyone, so in the "open source is good for Africa" sense, I agree with Cowen. But more importantly is the relative under-development of developing countries, and the relative malleability of their economic structures.

{% newthought "Keynes on Newton" %}, [delivered posthumously](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Keynes_Newton/): 

"Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago. Isaac Newton, a posthumous child bom with no father on Christmas Day, 1642, was the last wonderchild to whom the Magi could do sincere and appropriate homage."

{% newthought "Related to the Tony Tulathimutte" %}, three SFW links on porn: (1) [think about social media](https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/were-getting-the-social-media-crisis) like porn marketing: consumers want different things from customers; (2) *LA Weekly*'s porn journalist [writes about](https://logicmag.io/play/my-stepdad's-huge-data-set/) porn and data; (3) PornHub's 2024 [year in review](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2024-year-in-review).

{% newthought "Take a fact about media" %} and make it ideological: [a suprisingly good essay](https://www.anildash.com/2024/02/06/wherever-you-get-podcasts/) on the phrase "Wherever you get your podcasts."




## Music 

It's been a while since I've had a music section. Zakir Hussain died in December. He is the musician I most wish I could have seen live; I thought I had another decade at least. Shruti Rajagopalan's obituary of him is [here](https://srajagopalan.substack.com/p/zakir). I loved him best for his work with John McLaughlin and Béla Fleck; when he came on screen in *Monkey Man,* I confused DB by shouting aloud. 

Here are five 2024 albums I *loved*, which you might not have come across: 

**Dala Toni**, Ajate. "Experience the explosive encounter of Afro groove and Japanese traditional Ohayashi music!" Lots of fun. 

**Arwe**, Dingonek Street Band. Brooklyn jazz. I've come across Bobby Spellman before on some random playlist before, he put together this band.

**At The Drolma Wesel-Ling Monastery**, Howie Lee. Man, I don't know. But it's great. My favorite track is "Mantra of Buddha Akshobhya 不动佛心咒 ." And yes I did have to figure out how to get my website to render traditional Chinese script. 

**Into the Blue**, Aaron Frazer. Interesting singer-songwriter stuff. 

**Chorus**, Mildlife. Groovy.
