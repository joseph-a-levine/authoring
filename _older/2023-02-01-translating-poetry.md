Some translators search for perfection, which is of course impossible. Ezra Pound was sure that "No one has succeeded in translating Catullus into English," and not without trying: "I have failed forty times myself so I do know the matter." I was curious, and found two of Pound's translations from Catullus. They are not faithful; they're colloquial and condensed. His Catullus 85:


{% epigraph ' I hate and love. Why ? You may ask but <br> <br> It beats me. I feel it done to me, and ache. ' 'Catullus' ' LXXXV ' %}

> I hate and love. Why ? You may ask but 
> It beats me. I feel it done to me, and ache.
