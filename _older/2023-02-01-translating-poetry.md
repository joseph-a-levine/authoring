Some translators are trying to recreate the essence instead of the meaning of a poem.{% sidenote "jargo-id" "I'm certain there's jargon here, I don't know it and I'm not interested." %}  These translators are relatively more drawn towards perfection, which is of course impossible. Ezra Pound was sure that "No one has succeeded in translating Catullus into English," and not for lack of trying: "I have failed forty times myself so I do know the matter." I was curious, and found two of Pound's translations from Catullus. They are not faithful; they're colloquial and condensed. His Catullus 85:{% sidenote "warnsod-id" "Warning: I *so* don't know Latin. " %} 

{% epigraph ' I hate and love. Why? You may ask but <br> <br> It beats me. I feel it done to me, and ache. ' 'Catullus (trans. Pound)' ' LXXXV ' %}

I can't emphasize how much I don't know Latin â€” I can't compare the merits of the translations. I'm comparing Pound's translations to Green's and Michie's, which are both interesting and well-regarded. Green, for example, turns the second line ("*nescio, sed fieri sentio et excrucior.*") into "I have no idea. I just feel it. I am crucified." Google Translate gave me "I do not know, but I feel it happening and I am crucified."
