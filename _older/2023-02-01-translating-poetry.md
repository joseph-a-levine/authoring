Some translators search for perfection, which is of course impossible. Ezra Pound was sure that "No one has succeeded in translating Catullus into English," and not without trying: "I have failed forty times myself so I do know the matter." I was curious, and found two of Pound's translations from Catullus. They are not faithful; they're colloquial and condensed. His Catullus 85:


{% epigraph ' I hate and love. Why? You may ask but <br> <br> It beats me. I feel it done to me, and ache. ' 'Catullus (trans. Pound)' ' LXXXV ' %}{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "I *so* don't know Latin; do I have any idea what I'm talking about? No, not really. I'm comparing Pound's translations to Green's and Michie's, which are both interesting and well-regarded. Green, for example, turns the second line (nescio, sed fieri sentio et excrucior.) into 'I have no idea. I just feel it. I am crucified.' Google Translate gave me 'I do not know, but I feel it happening and I am crucified.'" %}
