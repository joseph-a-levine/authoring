## June, 2023

*A bit of a different structure this month, as my reading was interwoven with the things I did.*

## School
  
As May ends, we have three weeks left of classes — I'm taking a coding course{% sidenote "ermdbo-id" "In a language I've used for years." %} and a math course covering real analysis and measure theory.{% sidenote "fmmshad-id" "Both of which I've also studied before — measure theory, with the same professor who's teaching this course." %} Both are assessed pass/fail, so this couldn't possibly be lower stress. I've supplemented these courses with some personal practice, such as excessive amounts of R coding for research projects and slowly re-learning Julia, and personal reading. 

My contrarian streak keeps me from reading a book if it has *too many* effusively positive reviews. This has kept me from ever opening *Godel, Escher, Bach* or *The Power Broker* or *Sapiens*. Earlier this year I broke this rule for *The Jesuits: A history*{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "Enthusiastically reviewed by [Dan Wang](https://danwang.co/2022-letter/) and [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/02/the-jesuits-a-history.html), whose enthusiasm about new history books I've learned to adjust down by half." %} and had a great time; as part of my math-y supplements I broke it again for Reviel Netz's *A New History of Greek Mathematics*.{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "I was *almost* scared away by the [TLS](https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/a-new-history-of-greek-mathematics-reviel-netz-book-review-liba-taub/), [Viktor Blåsjö](https://intellectualmathematics.com/blog/review-of-netzs-new-history-of-greek-mathematics/), and, again, [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/04/a-new-history-of-greek-mathematics.html). " %} I'm so glad I did — Netz is a genius science communicator, and is the first person to get me to understand optics. I'll write a more thorough review of the book later, focusing on the astronomy aspects



## Summer VIIIs

> [I]n Eights Week the pleasures of Oxford are in their fullest bloom—possibly, like the evening of some splendid rose, getting a little blowzy. 
> 
> ...
> 
> [T]his is golden vicarage stuff, a dreamy Edwardian Oxford, all on a summer afternoon. All around you are summer frocks, proud mothers, experienced fathers and public-school accents—rowing being a sport cultivated especially at the independent schools, it has been more impervious than most Oxford pleasures to social change. The river flutters with pennants and bright colours. A noisy crowd of undergraduates seethes up and down the towpath, threaded by earnest rowing coaches carrying megaphones on bicycles. Wherever you look there are colours, blazers and white flannels, straw hats with ribbons, lemonade bottles and crested caps. A ferryman conveys a crew from one bank to the other, its oars standing upright in the punt like lances in a Spanish painting.
> 
> ...
> 
> A flash of oars you see first, with the drip of the water off their painted blades, and then the first of the racing shells comes sweeping to the finishing line—eight very English young men, with the wiry little coxswain bawling at them from the stern, and a raggle-taggle party of supporters still staggering breathless along the bank; and the girl beside you turns to her brother and asks vacuously which boat it is, and the father says testily that it's all on the race card anyway, and the mother tidies her back hair and murmurs well, Susan only asked, after all it is only a sort of game, and presently the whole affair bursts into strawberries, cool drinks, the splashing of coxswains thrown into the water, and happy little groups of people, white and blue and polka-dotted, strolling through the meadows back to college.
