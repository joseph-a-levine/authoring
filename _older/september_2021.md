## Reading <a name="books"></a>

This month, I spent hours reading memos from [this list](https://sriramk.com/memos) compiled by Sriram Krishnan at Andreessen Horowitz. 

In their memos, Zuckerberg, Jobs, and Gates shine as convincers. The acquisition of Instagram, one for the history books, wasn't decided by accountants or in board rooms (although both did their due diligence), it was decided because Mark Zuckerberg kept writing emails to Kevin Systrom. 

Krishnan's list has just five government memos, of which two are from political campaigns and one is from Du Pont Chemical company. The political ones are fascinating: read Hillary Clinton's 2008 chief strategist on how to [take down Obama](https://sriramk.com/memos/penn-memo.pdf). He's "all sizzle and no steak," he "lacks American roots," he's "unelectable except perhaps against Attila the Hun."

But this isn't the pinnacle of government memo writing. Some government memos probably contain too much CYOA to be interesting. On the other hand, as Krishnan notes, memos "typically seem to come into the public domain in one of three ways: through being really old, being part of some lawsuit/legal process or, sadly, being part of a hack." The most interesting ones come from hacks, and these are the ones Krishnan is least likely to put on his website. 

One of the most exciting war books I read this year was mostly a summary of memos and conversations about the Iraq war decision. "[Leap of Faith](https://smile.amazon.com/Leap-Faith-Negligence-Americas-Greatest/dp/1541768361?)" by Michael Mazarr collected memos from the White House, Pentagon, and NSC, which become characters in the story of Iraq. Donald Rumsfeld comes off the worst in his memo writing: one "urgent" (and unexplained) memo penned from his desk in 2002 reportedly read "Sunni vs Shia??" Rumsfeld was also deeply possessive of his briefings:

> If people began taking notes, he would sometimes tell them to stop. In one such session, according to someone present, Rice said she wanted to keep her copy of the slides. Rumsfeld refused and reached for them. The two were actually pulling the slides back and forth until Rice appealed to Bush, who was sitting at the head of the table: “Mr. President, I need to keep these.” Bush merely shrugged and left the room. Rice eventually surrendered her copy, but sent a staff member to the Pentagon to find another. 

We probably undervalue the memo. The most important one on Krishnan's list is from IBM's Thomas Watson, aimed at adjutants in the Pentagon during WWII. The focus is on "completed staff work."

> "Completed Staff Work" is the study of a problem, and presentation of a solution, by a staff officer, in such form that all that remains to be done on the part of the head of the staff division, or the commander, is to indicate his approval or disapproval of the completed action. 

Everyone I've ever worked for has been a busy person. They don't read what I write to learn, they read to act. When I was consulting, a memo could change policy or strategy. Now, working for researchers, a memo (occasionally taking the form of a literature review) informs experimental design or field planning. At it's best, a memo isn't information, it's action. 


This month, I want to highlight two nonfiction books about obscure Spanish politics, one written by a journalist and one written by a novelist. 

Twentieth century Spain has fantastic 

One character, mentioned in both books, is Carmen Franco, 1st Duchess of Franco and Francisco Franco's only child. She apparently called the Spanish coup of July 1936 an "armed referendum"


I have an increasingly hard time picking books to read. 

In some sense, I'm jealous of my friends who keep their Goodreads account up-to-date. Whatever my book-choosing algorithm is, Amazon's is likely better. 

However, I do have a philosophical problem with Goodreads' five-star book-rating system. This score can be useful, as a single dimensional measure of a books quality: one friend mentions that he "tries to read books with a 3.9 or higher" on Goodreads. One issue is that some of my favorite books are just *terrible*. My book choices don't always optimize for book quality. 

For an alternate view, see [Gleech's](https://www.gleech.org/books) "sort by controversy," the books for which his rating most disagrees with the average. All of them are overrated, i.e., he rates them low and the average reader rates them highly. 

There's an extensive literature on ratings systems.{% sidenote "legion" "And if there weren't, Amazon's [secret squad](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/13/tech/amazon-economists/index.html) of [economists](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/19-027_7e890058-c225-4803-a6f1-a6eb1db74027.pdf) would create one." %} Across Amazon product reviews, Uber ratings, and movie scores, anything below 4 is considered sub-par; intuitively, 2.5 should be average, right? I sometimes dream about systems where everyone doing the rating have to provide uniformly (or normally) distributed results. Instead, ratings are right-skewed. This makes no sense to me, and has apparently irritated me for years: here's a [screenshot](https://jablevine.com/assets/img/skewed.png) from a friend's instagram in 2017, when I was apparently already complaining!

## Writing <a name="writing"></a>

I received many useful comments on the draft of my paper on the long reflection, thank you to everyone for reaching out! I also found a pretty egregious coding error in my paper on the role of start-up cities in emigration reduction. Working with cross-national opinion data is hard. Both of these projects are back to the drawing board for now.

In the first days of October, I'm presenting a new paper on the natural resource curse at APSA 2021 in Seattle. I'll post the slides here, and I also have a full working draft. This draft is my writing sample for PhD applications in the Winter, so I would more than appreciate any comments! Please reach out if you're interested, or have even a second to take a look.

I'm also spending an inefficient amount of time writing and re-writing the personal statements for my PhD applications. One mentor who's been through the process said that, at this point, everything else about the application has been locked in (GRE, GPA, LoRs, CV). Even though the personal statement has a minimal role in admission decisions, it intuitively feels like the last bit of the application under my control. 

## Eating <a name="food"></a>

I moved apartments in early September, and, as part of the welcome package to my new home, I inherited about 25 cans of chickpeas. 

The most common response I've gotten, when I bring up my chickpea binge, is that I *must* re-try all of these recipes with dried chickpeas.
