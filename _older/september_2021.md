## Reading <a name="books"></a>

This month, I want to highlight two nonfiction books about obscure Spanish politics, one written by a journalist and one written by a novelist. 

Twentieth century Spain has fantastic 

One character, mentioned in both books, is Carmen Franco, 1st Duchess of Franco and Francisco Franco's only child. She apparently called the Spanish coup of July 1936 an "armed referendum"


I have an increasingly hard time picking books to read. 

In some sense, I'm jealous of my friends who keep their Goodreads account up-to-date. Whatever my book-choosing algorithm is, Amazon's is likely better. 

However, I do have a philosophical problem with Goodreads' five-star book-rating system. This score can be useful, as a single dimensional measure of a books quality: one friend mentions that he "tries to read books with a 3.9 or higher" on Goodreads. One issue is that some of my favorite books are just *terrible*. My book choices don't always optimize for book quality. 

For an alternate view, see [Gleech's](https://www.gleech.org/books) "sort by controversy," the books for which his rating most disagrees with the average. All of them are overrated, i.e., he rates them low and the average reader rates them highly. 

There's a fairly extensive literature on ratings systems.{% sidenote "legion" "And if there weren't, Amazon's [secret squad](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/13/tech/amazon-economists/index.html) of [economists](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/19-027_7e890058-c225-4803-a6f1-a6eb1db74027.pdf) would create one." %} Across Amazon product reviews, Uber ratings, and movie scores, anything below 4 is considered sub-par; intuitively, 2.5 should be average, right? I sometimes dream about systems where everyone doing the rating have to provide uniformly (or normally) distributed results. Instead, ratings are right-skewed. This makes no sense to me, and has apparently irritated me for years: here's a [screenshot](https://jablevine.com/assets/img/skewed.png) from a friend's instagram in 2017, when I was apparently already complaining!

I moved apartments in early September, and, as part of the welcome package to my new home, I inherited about 25 cans of chickpeas.
