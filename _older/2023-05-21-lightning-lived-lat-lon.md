Lightning is cool. Lances of heat and light bursting from the heavens and lighting stuff on fire and blowing stuff up are cool. None of this is advice. 

When lightning flashes, it heats the surrounding air to temperatures five times hotter than the surface of the sun, and it does so almost instantly. The video above captures 7,000 frames per second, and the flash, the return stroke, occurs within a single frame. This rapid heating causes the air to expand explosively, creating a shock wave that travels outward from the lightning channel.

I've seen great lightning and heard great thunder in my life{% sidenote "blads-id" "I watched intra-cloud bolts glitter in the night near the Freetown port... no, that can't be right..." %} but never after such a dry spell. This got me wondering — where and when in my life did I have the most exposure to  thunder?
