## Updates 

Oxford term time is back, which means routine (perhaps too much?) is back. I have a new chair with corduroy upholstery and a brown felt blanket, where I read most mornings from 6-8am. The same smoothie{% sidenote "smoot-id" "One banana <br> One apple <br> Fifteen ml of peanut butter <br> One fistful of frozen blueberries <br> Five ml tbsp of milled flaxseed <br> Fifty ml of greek yoghurt <br> Fifty g of chocolate protein powder <br> Quarter liter of milk" %} is back, at 8am every morning.{% sidenote "nf-id" "Except on Thursdays, when I get breakfast at Nuffield with DB, NE, CS, etc. " %} My desk has become more comfortable and productive, especially after dropping one of my three monitors.{% sidenote "char-id" "The desk chair has mysteriously dropped three screws in the past week, and I can't figure out where they came from. I expect to end up on the floor at any moment." %} This is especially good, as I've lost any ability to focus at my old office Trajan House — I end up talking to people or playing table tennis or reading on a beanbag or something. 

Evenings are much less structured, especially having just suffered clocks falling-back. This isn't the furthest north I've spent a winter, but the prospect of <eight-hour days is dreadful. I have no idea if this routine makes me more productive. I've reached the self-directed stage of the PhD,{% sidenote "sidenotestru" "Tho I'll return to a coursework structure for one term later this year." %} and "time sitting at a desk" isn't the best measure of productivity. I've been keeping myself accountable, both weekly with [MWG](https://jablevine.com/older/september_2023) and to everyone supporting my studies.


My PhD is being funded by the Heffernan-Sinclair Endowment from Brasenose College. Peter Sinclair was the economics tutor at Brasenose in the 1980s and 90s, and passed away during the cruel, disorienting first Covid wave in spring 2020. Many current economists have fond memories of Professor Sinclair: the [condolence book](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/social-sciences/peter-sinclair.aspx) at his final university, Birmingham, is over 40,000 words and would take me almost four hours to read aloud. There are notes from undergraduates he taught at Oxford and Birmingham; colleagues and coauthors; government officials from Indonesia, the UK, and Lesotho;{% sidenote "lso-id" "The [King of Lesotho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsie_III), in fact." %} bankers and nurses; childhood friends. 

Brasenose established the endowment [immediately](https://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/downloads/news/Professor_Peter_SinclairBowersappreciation2020.pdf) after Professor Sinclair's death, naming it after him and his first wife, Shelagh Heffernan, whom I know much less about. She passed away in 2010; her life's work was as a professor of banking at City University in London. She did her MPhil and DPhil at Oxford{% sidenote "oneyeml" "Back when a 3-term, 9 month DPhil was possible. Jealous." %} and wrote various books on *Sovereign Risk Analysis* and *Modern Banking in Theory and Practice*. Sinclair himself [donated £25,000](https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/legislation/shelagh-heffernan-awards-fund) in her name to the University later in the 2010s.

I never met Professors Heffernan or Sinclair. Dozens of their loved ones have donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to support my studies and to pay my stipend, but the connection I feel with these two adored academics is degrees-removed and elusive. I don't even work in the same field: their most cited papers, mostly on banking, are largely impenetrable to me. I was the inaugural recipient of this scholarship, but their legacy will fund students every two years, going forward. For two professors who touched [hundreds](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/social-sciences/peter-sinclair.aspx) of [students](https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/1245352500477263873)' [lives](https://www.legacy.com/ca/obituaries/theglobeandmail/name/shelagh-heffernan-obituary?id=41541153), their memory will remain a blessing.	

OK, onto schoolwork (which Professors Heffernan and Sinclair are actually expecting me to do). This term, I'm only taking one course, a mandatory methods course, meaning I'll take three in the spring term. I'm also auditing Noam Yuchtman's new course on political economy.

This is, instead, a research-focused term. The big requirement for this year is a completed thesis, which Meg Meyer advised us to think of as "in the direction of" our eventual dissertations. My advisor, Dennis Egger, is doing really cool work on cash transfers and public economics in Africa with a macro-bent. I'm still deciding on my topic; if I don't have a concrete description of my project here in my next monthly update, then you all should feel free to worry.

The Gambian project is also beginning to speed up. Victor Pouliquen, who pulled me onto the project, has also been introducing me to the delights of grant applications. In the genre of "academics complaining about grants," scientists usually win out, but running a major experiment with tens of thousands of participants in a poor country is also a difficult spot to be in. And beyond applying, once a grant is awarded, it takes months! to host the funds and begin to disburse them. And let's hope you're not going to hire anyone with these funds. If anything, I'm thankful to have been shielded from the application processes on the previous projects I worked on in Sierra Leone and India. But I did deal with most of the reporting requirements to the funders, and I'm equally dreading that.




## Reading

### Should I care about the intelligence of the animals I eat

> The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? 
Jeremy Bentham, *Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation*

Not separate from suffering, but above it — is it worse to torture, kill, and eat an intelligent than unintelligent animal? Many of my friends are v*gan; have worked at organizations promoting [animal welfare](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/) or started [websites](https://www.animalwelfarelibrary.org/). I eat meat. I also read a lot about non-human animals and how our society interacts with them. This isn't about that, but rather about animals most of us don't — currently — eat.{% sidenote "doeat-id" "Of course, we do eat intelligent animals. Pigs  solve mazes, pass mirror tests, vocalize, engage in complex play. " %}

Any list of the smartest animal would include great apes, elephants, some parrots, octopuses, maybe dolphins. This month, I read books about baboons, octopuses, and elephants.{% sidenote "banb-id" "The book about baboons — which are not great apes — was an accident, I read about octopuses largely for this purpose, and the essay and two books about elephants were prompted by MWG." %} I don't plan to change my eating habits because of these books — I wouldn't have eaten any of these species before, and still won't — but I did prod my intuition about how factors into my moral patience.

Humans do eat **primates**. It's now well-agreed that AIDS originated from bush meat, almost certainly from a chimpanzee, hunted and consumed in the Congo, soon before 1921.{% sidenote "orig-id" "Jacques Pépin's *The Origins of AIDS* is the scientific and legible history. I read it in 2020 and have returned to certain chapters for various reasons. The final chapter, *Assembling the puzzle*, tells the full story clearly. " %} But it is becoming rarer, which I attribute to unavoidable  and logical anthropomorphization. 

Humans do eat **elephants**. The elephant Orwell [shot](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/shooting-an-elephant/) was eaten: "Burmans were bringing dash and baskets even before I left, and I was told they had stripped his body almost to the bones by the afternoon." Eating elephants has never been common,{% sidenote "djjljdel-id" "Except for geologically brief eras during the human migration out of Africa, with various Proboscidea." %} and is becoming rarer, due to effective conservation among dwindling populations. 

My elephant spree started with Caitrin Keiper's massive "[Do Elephants Have Souls?](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/do-elephants-have-souls)" in The New Atlantis. Many of the epigraphs scattered throughout were drawn from Lyall Watson's *Elephantoms*. Watson was a South African zoologist; an excellent writer, but wholly too credible.{% sidenote "whbel-id" "The most fantastic moment in his book, which Keiper ended her essay with, was when 'the last remaining Knysna elephant' apparently has a conversation with a blue whale. I'm willing to accept nature is weird and animals are capable of much more than we imagine but the circumstances are much weirder than my short summary suggests and seriously come on dude." %} He is a great enough writer to make the book worth our time. 

Humans do eat **octopuses**. They are the worst off. It has always been difficult to catch and preserve octopuses, but technology is [making life easier for us and harder for them](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64814781).

### *Good Omens*

OK, something cheerier. Me and MWG read *Good Omens* to each other over the phone and voice messages, and I can confirm Neil Gaiman doesn't Do It For Me.
