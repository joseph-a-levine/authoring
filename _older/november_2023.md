## Updates 

Oxford term time is 

My PhD is being funded by the Heffernan Sinclair Endowment from Brasenose College. Peter Sinclair was the economics tutor at Brasenose in the 1980s and 90s, and passed away during the cruel, disorienting first Covid wave in spring 2020. Many current economists have fond memories of Professor Sinclair: his condolence book at his final university, Birmingham, is over 40,000 words and would take me almost four hours to read aloud. There are notes from undergraduates he taught at Oxford and Birmingham; colleagues and coauthors; government officials from Indonesia, the UK, and Kenya; bankers and nurses; childhood friends

Brasenose established the endowment a few days after Professor Sinclair's death, naming it after him and his first wife, Shelagh Heffernan, whom I know much less about. She passed away in 2010, as a professor of banking at City University in London. She did her MPhil and DPhil at Oxford{% sidenote "oneyeml" "Back when a 3-term, 9 month DPhil was possible. Jealous." %} and wrote various books on *Sovereign Risk Analysis* and *Modern Banking in Theory and Practice*. Sinclair himself [donated Â£25,000](https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/legislation/shelagh-heffernan-awards-fund) in her name to the University later in the 2010s.

I never met Professors Heffernan nor Sinclair. Dozens of their loved ones have donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to support my studies and to pay my stipend. 

I also don't work in the same field as either of them. Their most cited papers, mostly on banking, are largely impenetrable to me
