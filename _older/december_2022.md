title: What am I up to now?
---

In December, I finished the first semester of grad school, putting me roughly one-fifteenth of the way through. It was about what I expected, though with slightly more measure theory and fewer Hamiltonians. The first half of December was spent studying in various dignified libraries, MCRs, and Grand Halls around Oxford. Eventually I'll feel the urge to make a ranked list of "the best common rooms to do macro in," but they still blur together too much to make any distinction reasonable. For months I'm stuck in Oxford, these monthly updates will  blur together similarly.

## Travel

I hit London, DC, and New York for ~a week each this month. I didn't spend nearly enough time hanging out with my beloved sisters but such is life. On 1 January, I fly to CDMX. If you'll be in the area, let me know! 

Also, I'm planning a 1-2 month Central Asian trip next summer; something like Tajikistan -> Uzbekistan -> Kazakhstan (or vice versa). Recommendations and introductions are welcome!

## Reading 

[Here's a list](https://jablevine.com/older/2022_books) of the ~140 books I read in 2022, with some mini-reviews in the sidenotes. Borges and Shakespeare appeared most frequently. 

In mid-December, I spent six days in bed with the flu and finished six books. Some of these had been sitting on the backburner for a while;{% sidenote "comchcol" "**Comm Check**, a journalistic account of the *Columbia* disaster, and a new history of YouTube from Mark Bergen." %} others felt appropriate to the moment — Schopenhauer's **Essays and Aphorisms** are accessible and misanthropic, perfect for the brain fog and misery of a high fever. I intended to skip the metaphysics — is now the time for an essay "on the antithesis of thing in itself and appearance"? — and only persevered through momentum. The back-to-back zingers "On Suicide" and "On Women" gave me an "[oh my god, Arthur was racist](https://youtu.be/wwDGm6JO4Lw?t=32)" moment, but it turns out Schopenhauer's cynicism runs much deeper than that. 

My favorite, and the most generally interesting section, were the aphorisms on law and politics. Schopenhauer seems to go philosopher-by-philosopher, attempting to piss off in turn. He quotes Voltaire on monarchy, then argues governments should only allow freedom of the press "upon the strictest prohibition of any kind of anonymity," which would have sparked an angry pamphlet from Monsieur Arouet. Schopenhauer also deserves credit for introducing me to the Hobbesian side of Spinoza — "Unusquisque tantum juris habet, quantum potentid valet."{% sidenote "latinspi" "A person's rights are equivalent to his power." %}{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "Did Spinoza get a chance to read *Leviathan*? SEP asserts Spinoza read *De Cive* (which I only know from PolPhil101), but *Leviathan* seems much more up Spinoza's alley. The timing is a bit tight, tho, with Baruch's early death-by-glass." %} 

There were two especially fun arguments, which wrap around in unexpected, [Chestertonian](https://twitter.com/stevenkaas/status/144899078222921729) ways: 

> Republics are anti-natural, artificial and derive from reflection : consequently there are also very few of them in the entire history of mankind, namely the little Greek republics and the Roman and Carthaginian re- publics, and these were all made possible by the fact that five- sixths, perhaps even seven-eighths of their population consisted of slaves. The case is similar in the United States of North America: in the year 1840, of a population of 16 millions, three millions were slaves. The duration of the republics of antiquity was, moreover, very brief compared with that of the monarchies. Republics are in general easy to establish but hard to maintain : precisely the opposite is true of monarchies.

Therefore: 

> If you want Utopian plans, I would say: the only solution to the problem is the despotism of the wise and noble members of a genuine aristocracy, a genuine nobility, achieved by mating the most magnanimous men with the cleverest and most gifted women. 

Second: 

> Poverty and slavery are thus only two forms of - one might almost say two words for - the same thing, the essence of which is that a man's energies are expended for the most part not on his own behalf but on that of others; the outcome being partly that he is overloaded with work, partly that his needs are very inadequately met.
> ...
> It is therefore a fact that the people is sovereign: but this sovereignty never comes of ageand therefore has to remain under the permanent care of a guardian.

Other fun bits include a [potshot at color theory](https://xkcd.com/1882/):

> On the other hand, in our own day Newton's absurd theory of colours still holds the field, forty years after the appearance of Goethe's.

and a personal attack on my love of parentheses and sidenotes:

> The guiding principle in the art of composition should be that the human being can think clearly only one thought at a time, so that he should not be asked to think two, not to speak of more than two thoughts at the same time. — But this is what he is being asked to do when parentheses are inserted into sentences which have been broken up to accommodate them, a practice which causes unnecessary and wanton confusion. German writers are the worst offenders in this respect.

### **Measure for Measure**

M4M is one of the four [problem plays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespearean_problem_play) F.S. Boas named when he coined the term.{% sidenote "probhamle" "Along with *Troilus and Cressida*, *All's Well That Ends Well*, and *Hamlet*." %} I've never really understood whether Boas meant that these plays *are* problems, or that they're *about* problems, but twice reading M4M this winter has pushed me towards the first explanation: these plays are messy.{% sidenote "whywritshapscrit" "I often write down my thoughts when I read or reread Shakespeare, but am reluctant to put those thoughts here. My reading of the deep canon of criticism is thin — I've read Goddard, and the *Analysis* section of most plays' Wikipedia pages — that fear of naïveté or unoriginality kept me quiet. In this case, I'll say fuck it — if my analysis is naïve, at least it's honest; if it's unoriginal, at least the idea's been proven elsewhere. Let me know if either or both are true. " %} 

In M4M, the Duke of Vienna wants to start enforcing laws about fornication. But he quite likes being popular, and realizes that executing fornicators would make him unpopular. So he takes to scheming — he will tell the city he is on a "diplomatic mission to Poland",{% sidenote "dipmispol" "That's what the kids are calling it these days." %} while actually disguising himself as a [friar](https://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/into-the-friar/) and observing [the effects of good government in the city](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/effects-of-good-government-in-the-city/WAFg-CSkcQJsMw?hl=en). To implement this just, sexless government is Angelo, a 



### Monthly Le Guin

Ursula Le Guin intended ["Introducing Myself"](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/IntroducingMyself.html) as a "a performance piece, performed a couple of times." While none of these performances are on YouTube, I like to imagine the effect of watching the septuagenarian Le Guin standing up in a bookshop or college auditorium and saying: 

> I am a man. Now you may think I’ve made some kind of silly mistake about gender, or maybe that I’m trying to fool you, because my first name ends in a , and I own three bras, and I’ve been pregnant five times, and other things like that that you might have noticed, little details. But details don’t matter. If we have anything to learn from politicians it’s that details don’t matter. I am a man, and I want you to believe and accept this as a fact, just as I did for many years.

No one can accuse Le Guin of making silly mistakes about gender,{% sidenote "tegendlue" "My favorite recent weird gender book is Ada Palmer's *Terra Ignota*; in an interview, Dr. Palmer said her dream reviewer would have been Ursula Le Guin. " %} and this essay is one of her more truculent  and sardonic commentaries. While she is a man, she's "a kind of second-rate or imitation man, a Pretend-a-Him." 

> I am to a genuine male him as a microwaved fish stick is to a whole grilled Chinook salmon. I mean, after all, can I inseminate? Can I belong to the Bohemian Club? Can I run General Motors? Theoretically I can, but you know where theory gets us. 

There's also a delightful riff on Hemingway. Highly recommended.

## Listening

Spotify Wrapped is a challenging time of year. I usually don't know how to answer the question, "What type of music do you listen to?" But every December, I'm confronted by my revealed preferences; it's rarely flattering. This year was particularly confusing: in my top five most-listened to songs were [Avril Lavigne](https://open.spotify.com/track/6m0Dk7Cm7rWQLzCjeYIiIt?si=9e5ab85d2d544256), [Mikhail Glinka](https://open.spotify.com/track/19ocRIYxL4h6lKJFIxXnWF?si=3c0f13265ee9486d), and the great blues guitarist [Johnny Winter](https://open.spotify.com/track/2ufOnRuG6tOacEWlsI1JER?si=1662d6784cb64f68). My most-played artists were The Beatles and Taylor Swift. 

While almost a quarter of the books I read this year were written in languages other than English, anglophone music dominated my listening. Of my 100 most listened to songs, only six had lyrics not in English, and four of those were in Spanish. I'm disappointed in myself — the majority of *new* (lyrical) music I listen to isn't in English.{% sidenote "lyrpul" "Tho the plurality is." %} Why I do listen to so much linguistically challenging music once, then never again? 

The music I listen to on repeat has three purposes: singing in the shower,{% sidenote "showermusic" "Country, folk, Jason Mraz, and other genres with accessible ranges." %} doing math,{% sidenote "mathmsuic" "Latin guitar, hard bop, and Zakir Hussein." %} and long plane rides.{% sidenote "planemusic" "The Steve Miller Band's 'Jet Airliner,' Vivaldi, and Bach." %} All of these make good showings on my revealed preference list, but 

### New stuff, no English lyrics allowed

*Masikini Naye Mtu (The Poor are Also People)*, Jamaica Mnanda. [Listen here](https://jamaica.bandcamp.com/album/masikini-naye-mtu-the-poor-are-also-people). Fast-paced, political Senegalese music, with two less-traditional remixes. 

*Szól a Világ*, Napfonat. Listen on Spotify. Catchy Hungarian a capella, pretty poppy. 

*Templo Komodo*, Briela Ojeda. Listen on Spotify. Man, I've got no idea what this is. But it's great. The title track and Doña Justicia are return tracks.
