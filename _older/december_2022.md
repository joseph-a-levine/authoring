## Travel

I hit London, DC, and New York for ~a week each this month. On 1 January, I fly to CDMX. If you'll be in the area, let me know! 

Also, I'm planning a 1-2 month Central Asian trip next summer; something like Tajikistan -> Uzbekistan -> Kazakhstan (or vice versa). Recommendations and introductions are welcome!

## Reading 

[Here's a list](https://jablevine.com/older/2022_books) of the ~140 books I read in 2022, with some mini-reviews in the sidenotes. Borges and Shakespeare appeared most frequently. 

In mid-December, I spent six days in bed with the flu and finished six books. Some of these had been sitting on the backburner for a while;{% sidenote "comchcol" "**Comm Check**, a journalistic account of the *Columbia* disaster, and a new history of YouTube from Mark Bergen." %} others felt appropriate to the moment — Schopenhauer's **Essays and Aphorisms** are accessible and misanthropic, perfect for the brain fog and misery of a high fever. I intended to skip the metaphysics — is now the time for an essay "on the antithesis of thing in itself and appearance"? — and only persevered through momentum. The back-to-back zingers "On Suicide" and "On Women" gave me an "[oh my god, Arthur was racist](https://youtu.be/wwDGm6JO4Lw?t=32)" moment, but it turns out Schopenhauer's cynicism runs much deeper than that. 

He also gets credit for introducing me to the Hobbesian side of Spinoza — "Unusquisque tantum juris habet, quantum potentid valet."{% sidenote "latinspi" "A person's rights are equivalent to his power." %}{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "Did Spinoza get a chance to read *Leviathan*? SEP asserts Spinoza read *De Cive* (which I only know from PolPhil101), but *Leviathan* seems much more up Spinoza's alley. The timing is a bit tight, tho, with Baruch's early death-by-glass." %}
