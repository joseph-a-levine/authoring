title: What am I up to now?

## November, 2021

For the William & Mary alumni magazine, Noah Robertson writes a tremendously flattering [article](https://magazine.wm.edu/issue/2021-fall/power-analyst.php) on my work with Team Afghan Power. The article unfortunately went to press before the Taliban's summer campaign,{% sidenote "talib" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vimZj8HW0Kg" %} and paints an overly optimistic picture of how our work will persist. Noah followed up, and published an [article](https://magazine.wm.edu/online-exclusives/finish-the-mission.php) about the fantastic work John Gerlaugh  has been doing to aid the evacuation of vulnerable populations. 

My sisters were not as flattered, and it's my fault. 

> All this came as a surprise to his family, who rarely stray from home. Both of his sisters now live close to their colleges. His family is still in the Washington area. Meanwhile Levine hasn’t lived in the same place for more than 10 months since high school.

One friend who recently enrolled at W&M texted my sister Abigail, "I didn't know you've never left your front porch." Sorry! 

While looking through the Fall 2021 Alumni magazine, I found [this article](https://magazine.wm.edu/online-exclusives/where-is-china-secretly-spending.php) about AidData's new China aid-spending database.{% sidenote "aiddata" "AidData is a W&M research lab; I worked for affiliated researchers in 2015 and 2018, the whole time I was at the school." %} The basic problem in analyzing international aid flows is that, unlike most donors, China does not report their spending. There is no transparency in where or how China gives aid: AidData fixed that.{% sidenote "oecd" "The OECD Development Assistance Committee has set the canonical reporting guidelines. These are less than perfect. One of my favorite blog series is [David Roodman](https://davidroodman.com/blog/tag/redefining-oda/) on how these guidelines help some rich countries at the expense of others." %} 

> “Our goal is to triangulate information on each project that the Chinese government is bankrolling with as many reliable sources as possible. We track down the grant and loan agreements published in the official gazettes and legislative repositories. We scrape all of the project-specific information that is posted on Chinese embassy websites. We review aid and debt information management systems of finance and planning ministries in host countries. We correspond directly with government officials, investigative journalists and contractors on the ground with firsthand knowledge about these projects. Then, after standardizing and synthesizing all of this information we’re able to see the big picture — the known universe of Chinese government-financed projects.”

In October, I spoke with a research assistant here in Freetown about his dissertation, which he's writing to finish his Masters degree at a university here. His main data source was AidData!

## Reading <a name="books"></a>


Earlier this year, I had my sisters recommend three harry potter fan fictions each, what was like 2,000 pages of content they really liked. There is this whole subculture of fanfiction which is the main source of literature for tens of millions of americans, and hundreds of millions worldwide. I wanted to understand the subculture, and reading a few of the most popular stories was an interesting peak in

I feel that, by not being on tiktok, i'm missing out on a similar subculture, but by 100x or 1000x. From [Eugene Wei](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat): 

> TikTok’s algorithm is the Sorting Hat from the Harry Potter universe. Just as that magical hat sorts students at Hogwarts into the Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin houses, TikTok’s algorithm sorts its users into dozens and dozens of subcultures.


## Listening <a name="music"></a>

Wilco, "Sky Blue Sky"
Chairlift, "Moth"
The Strokes, "Room on Fire"

My wonderful mother found someone to hand-deliver a birthday present, including a new pair of headphones (I was down to my third back-up pair!). Most-improved-record on a good set of phones goes to Lizzo's "'Cuz I Love You."
