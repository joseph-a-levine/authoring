[Alex Teytelboym](https://t8el.com/), who tells his PhD students to call him Sasha, was lecturing us last week on social choice theory. In his introductory lecture, he covered famous results which most of us vaguely recalled from undergrad microeconomics.

The Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem is the second most important result in social choice; it was proven independently by Gibbard and Satterthwaite in 1973 and 1975, respectively. The theorem says that if voters have at least three options to choose from, and they are able to rank their preferences, then any voting system that can be strategically manipulated by voters to improve their chances of getting their preferred outcome will sometimes lead to a situation where no single voter's preferences are fully represented. 

In a set of notes on the topic, I learned the theorem was substantially older. David Craven at Birmingham wrote, "The [] theorem was conjectured in 1961 by Michael Dummett and Robin Farquharson." And then, in a footnote: "Farquharson studied at Brasenose,{% sidenote "brasco-id" "My college, at Oxford." %} then Queenâ€™s and Nuffield,{% sidenote "colnuf-id" "The college where I spend most of my time." %} before going insane."{% marginfigure "kacz-figure-id" "assets/img/Kacz_footnote.png" "A competitively-good footnote, from [this paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27643011)." %}
