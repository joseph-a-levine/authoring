## Updates

I spent most of July visiting my family in DC with my wonderful girlfriend. Being home was nice, although MWG now gets along with my parents dog better than I do. 

While in the US, I also attended a conference on the economics of animal welfare at Brown. This was a compact, diverse event; several friends presented. Loren Fryxell{% sidenote "market-id" "On the market this winter from Oxford!" %} presented an older theory paper well-adapted to crowd, with an interesting methodology for valuing animal wellbeing. Jojo XYZ did ABC. Luis Mota presented joint work with Kevin Kuruc. Tyler Cowen made the case for GLP-1 inhibitors being the most important trend in animal welfare,{% sidenote "glp-id" "People on Ozempic persistently consume about 20% fewer calories; some of these calories are meat; therefore fewer animals are being tortured and slaughtered." %} although he later recanted on his [blog](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/the-economics-of-glp-1.html). 

Over those three days, I repeatedly heard that this field is only one AER, one JEP, one top-tier applied micro JMP away from the big-time. No one knows what this paper will be about or who will write it, but it's on the way. Then we would sit down and listen to a presentation of a new normative principle which implies a specific utility representation, followed by a discussion of how to best label eggs. Every talk at the conference was valuable and interesting — but the gestalt didn't feel like a field coming together. It felt like a group of clever and empathetic academics gathering to talk about their own interests, with a very narrow intersection. 

Of course, fields have been born from less. If order must be imposed on the economic field of animal welfare, then I look forward to the next conference. But impact is the goal: materially improving animal welfare. That means getting useful research into the hands of the FAW team at Open Phil, or influencing policymakers. That may require narrowing the field, before we broaden it.

{% newthought "Now I'm back in" %} Oxford, indulging in lots of Olympics through the full coverage bundle from Discovery+. I'm writing this during the cross country mountain biking final. Discovery+ finds expert commentators for each sport: the usual pattern is a broadly experienced sports commentator paired with a recently retired athlete in each sport for color. The two mountain biking commentators narrarated an engrossing race: about 25 minutes into a 90 minute race, the reigning champ, Team GB Tom Pidcock, had to change his front tire, losing his lead and putting him 40 seconds back. Over the next hour, he clawed his way into a tie for first going into the final lap, and battled it out with a Frenchman. He won gold to loud boos from the home crowd.

That's the story from just one event — the men's triathlon was just as nail-biting; all the individual fencing events and canoe slalom and archery were just as deeply covered. The enthusiasm of the commentators occasionally exceeds that of the athletes. 

Which is not to underestimate the difficulty of the job: the commentary has to explain what's going on to total novices while not boring the fanatics. As embedded as they are in their sport, they occasionally miss the balance: the cross country cycling commentators continually teased us with mention of the Swiss rider Flueckiger "recent well-known controversy"; the fencing commentators teach us that "epee is the only weapon without right-of-way" — for those of us who know the details of right-of-way, but are unaware of the relevant weapons.

## Reading

"Genre fiction" is a slur, meaning "bad fiction". It's the embarassing stuff, the books which, if you're a person-who-reads, you never admit to reading. I am one of the most person-who-reads who ever read, and I'm here to say: <small>I read 10,000 pages of sci-fi, fantasy, and alternate history this month</small>. 

There's the spectrum of intellecutally respectable entertainment which is particularly acute in Oxford. Re-reading *The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* by a fire in the Senior Common Room is at one end;{% sidenote "joke-id" "The old joke: A student at Oxford attends a cocktail party with members of the faculty. Hoping to impress these august dons, the student casually mentions, &quot;I was reading Gibbon the other night…&quot; Later, the student's faculty mentor pulls him aside to chide him for the comment. &quot;One must never say one is *reading* Gibbon,&quot; he says. &quot;One must always say one is *re-reading* Gibbon.&quot; " %} the Booker nominees are already edging the bounds of respectability; Blackwell's on Broad Street must deny selling any sci-fi published after 1973. 

Further, as someone whose identity is tied up in reading, I'm quite unclear on what I mean when I say "I like to read." Of course, I like to read for work — I consume endless books on topics I'm writing or researching on. I also read plenty of books which are not work and not purely fun: last month I wrote about a history of the kings of the Henriad and a biography of an early American midwife. This isn't entertainment; it doesn't replace other people's Netflix or TikTok, but it is the central example of my reading practice. 

But I don't have Netflix or TikTok{% sidenote "pre-id" "I have to be pretentions somehow." %} so when I seek the same pure-entertainment rush, I end up in genre fiction. 

Everyone is different. A new friend, who works as a copy editor in London, reads extensively on his own time, literally for practice.{% sidenote "sui-id" "Or perhaps he's particularly well-suited for his career." %} I've never seen MWG read a book I would call "fun," and certainly not genre fiction, without the severest of encouragements. Her taste runs towards titles like *Regulating Bodies* and *Rights for Robots.*

On my trip back to DC, I started *Mother of Learning* a 3,000 page fantasy series. 

After finishing that, I read the 7,000 page web serial *Worm*. 

Finally, since returning to Oxford, I've charged through the first five books in the massive *1632* series. 

None of these are good literature; all of them are genre fiction. The intersection is not empty, however. Occasionally, something breaks out of genre fiction and into just normal fiction, or even literary fiction. Ursula Le Guin





Having written all of that, my ego wants to compensate by discussing all of the high status things I've read recently. Three books by G.K. Chesterton, a collection of Chekhov's stories, two Shakespeare plays, and a few chapters of Milton. Ah, that feels better — 

The best response I got to my books question from last month (“are there old-but-popular things that don’t get labeled “classics”?'') was detective fiction. Specifically convincing was Sherlock Holmes.

These are various interesting or fun things I've found on the internet this month.

{% newthought "I probably won't read" %} [this book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Chinese-Computer-Global-History-Information/dp/0262047519) on the history of Chinese keyboards, but I've read three [book](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/05/27/1092876/type-chinese-computer-qwerty-keyboard/) [reviews](https://spectrum.ieee.org/chinese-keyboard) of it. Sounds interesting for any friends working with or designing complicated UIs.
