title: What am I up to now?

## August, 2021

I don't really know what's happening in Afghanistan. Having visited twice, I'm the go-to expert for questions from grandparents, uncles, and family friends.  

Most of my time in the country was spent in the Panjshir valley, now featured on CNN as the last stand against the Taliban. Any resistance—organized or not—against the new regime will be organized or supplied from this small province north of Kabul. The valley, with a population of maybe 200,000, has hosted many wars. Alexander the Great passed through on his way to and from India, and Tamerlane camped on the grounds of the modern provincial football stadium. Along the main highway, kids have turned burned-out Russian tanks into playgrounds; the tailcone of MiG-dropped gravity bombs are used as traffic cones. And there are so many discarded artillery shells from various occupiers that Panjshiris use them in construction. 

My experience there gives me a fair view of the future of the country, but practically no insight into how the Afghan security forces collapsed so quickly. 

The past month has made it clear what do-gooders can achieve, and what they can't. Health outcomes are spectacular; political outcomes were not. 

Book reviews are abbreviated this month, as I've been doing a lot more writing than reading.

## Reading <a name="books"></a>

As I mentioned a [couple of months ago](https://jablevine.com/older/june_2021), I do all of my reading in Sierra Leone on my Kindle. The days when a year of field research means "[little or no access to books](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/07/which-books-to.html)"  are gone, thanks to epubs and mobis. Unfortunately, not all books are available as as ebooks. So I took advantage of the only permanent address I have, and ordered a couple dozen books to my parents house in Maryland. Here are some of the highlights I brought back with me. 

"How to Make Love To a Negro Without Getting Tired" and "The Sellout"

I also brought back Parfit's "Reasons and Persons." I've read the opening sentence{% sidenote "cat" "<q>Like my cat, I often simply do what I want to do.</q> /n Parfit, the subject of my [favorite magazine profile](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/09/05/how-to-be-good), did not in fact own a cat, nor did he want to. But he liked the sound of this sentence so much that he signed an agreement with his sister to take legal, but not practical, possession of her cat." %} at least a dozen times, and the first hundred pages three times. But I've never been able too crack any deeper on my Kindle or computer screen. 

Parfit stores axioms and thought experiments like variables and functions  in a massive .do file. In one chapter, Parfit will define claim S10{% sidenote "s10" "<q>I can rationally ignore desires that are not mine.</q>" %} and posit argument P5{% sidenote "p5" "<q>I can rationally now ignore desires that are not mine now.</q>" %}, so he can write ten pages later that, "according to the Appeal to Full Relativity, if we accept (S10) we should also accept (P5). Since an S-Theorist must accept (S10), but cannot accept (P5), he must reject the Appeal to Full Relativity." This would be easy to follow on a computer screen if moral philosophy were written like code. It's not, though, and having a hard copy is my only hope. After two weeks, I'm further along than I've ever been before{% sidenote "star" "Up to <q>Simple Teletransportation and the Branch-Line Case</q>, which pulls of the rare argument-from-Star-Trek quite well." %}, and enjoying it.  

Borges, "Ficciones" and "Selected Non-Fictions"

I read a lot of short stories; the genre with the biggest comparative advantage in short stories is science fiction. Borges was a revelation. 

On blindness: 
> One of the colors that the blind—or at least this blind man—do not see is black; another is red. Le rouge et le noir are the colors denied us. I, who was accustomed to sleeping in total darkness, was bothered for a long time at having to sleep in this world of mist, in the greenish or bluish mist, vaguely luminous, which is the world of the blind. I wanted to lie down in darkness. The world of the blind is not the night that people imagine.



"A Deepness in the Sky" and "The City in the Middle of the Night"

[Matt Clancy](https://mattsclancy.substack.com/) recently ran the first ever EconTwitter science fiction book club, inspiring me to read Vernor Vinge's "[A Deepness in the Sky](https://smile.amazon.com/Deepness-Sky-Zones-Thought-Book-ebook/dp/B002H8ORKM)." Vinge's work on [technological forecasting](https://arbital.com/p/Vingean_uncertainty/), less well known, is very impressive. 

"The Moral Economy of the Peasant" and "The Economic Theory of Agrarian Institutions"

For the flight back, "Whereabouts: Notes on Being a Foreigner" and "The Clothing of Books" 

## Listening <a name="music"></a>

This month, I took Ted Gioia's [One Hundred Best Albums of 2020](http://tedgioia.com/bestalbumsof2020.html) and listened to a random pick (almost) everyday. 

The only one I regretted listening to was the soundtrack to "**Color Out of Space**", a 2019 horror movie about a Lovecraftian meteor. I have always been in the [Munroe school](https://xkcd.com/2056/) of thought regarding horror movies, and have now learned that this extends to their soundtracks. The highest compliment I can give is "effective."

The album I returned to most frequently was Lyra Pramuk's "**Fountain**". Weird, something hidden. I'm still trying to figure it out.

Also excellent, with broad appeal: Georgie Sweet's "**Misunderstood**" and Shabaka and the Ancestors' "**We Are Sent Here by History**." Shabaka Hutchings on various wind instruments, backed by Ariel Zamonsky on bass, makes this one of my favorite popular jazz albums. I didn't get the afrofuturist vibe which [some reviewers](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shabaka-and-the-ancestors-we-are-sent-here-by-history/) called out; too much fatalism. Start with "The Coming of the Strange Ones."

The album which I recommended to the most friends (which of course says more about my friends than the quality of the music) is Dirty Projectors "**5EPs**." 

The overall winner, however, has to be The Westerlies' "**Wherein Lies the Good**." This is a magical record and the "Entropy" suite which concludes the track listing might be my most-listened to track of 2021.

Finally, being within a three-hour time difference of San Francisco, I was able to listen to many more Giant's games than from Freetown. Jon Miller 



## Writing <a name="writing"></a>

I'm circulating a draft of my paper on the [long reflection](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H2zno3ggRJaph9P6c/quotes-about-the-long-reflection); if this sounds interesting to you, [let me know](https://jablevine.com/hi) and I'll send it along. I've got two other working papers on political economy up on my research page; I'm scheduled to present both of these at APSA 2021 in Seattle.
