## September, 2022

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am becoming increasingly convinced that the best part of a PhD is the summer before you start it, when you get to tell everyone you’re doing a PhD and they’re all like “oh that’s so cool” but you don’t have to actually do any of the PhD yet.</p>&mdash; Nikhil Basavappa (@NikhilBasavappa) <a href="https://twitter.com/NikhilBasavappa/status/1274727800403042310?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>{% sidenote "nikh" "I've met Nikhil; the first two years of his PhD went much better than this tweet might imply." %}

At 6am on 26 September, I landed at London Heathrow airport; at 9am I walked into the first class of my PhD.{% sidenote "caveat" "Not a PhD. See the caveat on my [homepage](https://jablevine.com/)." %} Friends and classmates told me this was cutting it a bit close, but I was glad to use every last minute of my last month not subject to the tyranny of grad school. 

In short: I moved into my new house in Oxford; we hosted a housewarming (I made a giant vegan chili); I went back to Bern for three days; I flew to New Jersey; I kissed four women in 24 hours; I worked in Columbia University's Law Library; I went to New Haven; I worked in the [Elizabethan Clubhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_Club); I drove an ambulance to three car wrecks, four cardiac arrests, one stabbing, and one case of the hiccups; I ate soup dumplings with my dad and a Reuben with my grandma; I attended EAG DC for at least 10 hours; I made it to the first class of my PhD with at least ten minutes to spare. 

My libertine September sprang from heterogeneous feelings. Since stepping back from my work at GPI following the June workshops, I have been content. Travel has been a blessing, I've spent time with dozens of close friends; I've read great books and listened to good music; I've done work which I feel is important. This sufficiant frame of mind persisted everywhere I went. Preparing for the first day of school, my first first day since 2017, I felt a wave of imminent stress looming over me. This wave hasn't crested yet, maybe it never will. The first year of economics programs has a reputation, and that reputation is stress.

I was surprised how difficult it is to reconcile these themes of summer 2022. I've felt content and stressed at the same time; the camaraderie of responding to a car crash on an ambulance or working on a short-turnaround deliverable for an important client replicate some of these feelings. What has been different is the *anticipation* of stress. 

It occurred to me, throughout the summer, that there are probably things I can do to limit how unpleasant the first term will be. And I did some of these things! Phil Trammell lent me the flashcards he had made in the first year of the MPhil; two different professors sent me their copies of Simon & Blume;

## Eating 

I'm interested to see how my eating habits develop in October.

Memorable meals:
- Soup dumplings in Fairfax
- **Corado's** in Mt. Pleasant, with Michael Pusic. I met Michael when McKinsey seconded him to the Mayor of Freetown's office; we lived in the same house behind the Chinese embassy for a few months.{% sidenote "bdayw" "Michael also threw me the worst birthday party I've ever had, entirely by accident. People started showing up for the weekly house dinner around 7pm, and I was throwing up from food poisoning by 8pm. " %} This Guatemalan diner is a block or so from his house, and Michael's doing his best to make it a regular haunt. It's a great choice, the chile relleno was perfect and the camarones al corado was the best spicy shrimp dish I've had in DC. But I think Michael's partiality to Corado's is doomed to fail — after tearing through his salad, he spent a few minutes chatting with the waitress in Spanish trying to find a vegetarian starter or entrée. He ended up with an order of chips and pico de gallo.  
- Old Angler's Inn with grandma

During September, I spent three Sundays at Bethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad, a volunteer fire department I've been a member of since 2018. Most nights, the ambulances and fire apparatus will go into town to get take out. On Sunday nights, however, we cook. 
Regularly cooking for 15-20 people is a different experience than 

I applied the same strategy in Oxford earlier this month. I moved into my house in Oxford on September 2nd, and we hosted a housewarming party on the 3rd.
