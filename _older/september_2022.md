## September, 2022

At 6am on 26 September, I landed at London Heathrow airport; at 9am I walked into the first class of my PhD.{% sidenote "caveat" "Not a PhD. See the caveat on my [homepage](https://jablevine.com/)." %} Friends and classmates told me this was cutting it a bit close, but I was glad to use every last minute of my last month not subject to the tyranny of grad school. 

In short: I moved into my new house in Oxford; we hosted a housewarming (I made a giant vegan chili); I went back to Bern for three days; I flew to New Jersey; I kissed four women in 24 hours; I worked in Columbia University's Law Library; I went to New Haven; I worked in the [Elizabethan Clubhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_Club); I drove an ambulance to three car wrecks, four cardiac arrests, one stabbing, and one case of the hiccups; I ate soup dumplings with my dad and a Reuben with my grandma; I attended EAG DC for at least 10 hours; I made it to the first class of my PhD with about ten minutes to spare. 

My libertine September was inspired by heterogeneous feelings. Since stepping back from my work at GPI following the June workshops, I have been content. Travel has been a blessing, I've spent time with dozens of close friends; I've read great books and listened to good music; I've done useful and important work. This sufficiant frame of mind persisted everywhere I went. Preparing for the first day of school, my *first* first day since 2017, I felt a wave of imminent stress looming over me. This wave hasn't crested yet, maybe it never will. But the first year of economics programs have a reputation.

I was surprised how difficult it is to reconcile these themes of summer 2022. I've felt content and stressed at the same time; the camaraderie of responding to a car crash on an ambulance or working on a short-turnaround deliverable for an important client replicate some of these feelings. What has been different is the *anticipation* of stress. 

It occurred to me, throughout the summer, that there are probably things I can do to limit how unpleasant the first term will be. And I did some of these things! [Phil Trammell](https://philiptrammell.com/) lent me the flashcards he made in the first year of his MPhil; two different professors sent me their copies of Simon & Blume; I watched the entire online lectures from ASU, Chicago, and UMinnesota math camps. But I do not expect this to make much difference to how dumb I feel over the next few months. This is a feature of the first year — the Department is trying to cram as much knowledge and intuition into our brains so we can do good research. The feeling of dumbness is accurate and I'm fine with that! I just expect to find it unpleasant. 

The important decision of the last week of the month was my class schedule.{% sidenote "fern" "Probably the most important decision of the month overall, besides how much of my back garden to allocate to ferns, and how much to allocate to  a tulip/daffodil aggregate." %}  All economics first years, everywhere in the world, take micro, macro, & metrics. I don't get any choice on the topics, but Oxford's new MPhil/DPhil does allow for choice in difficulty. The eight of us in the cohort are told to take either one or two of these classes at an "advanced" level. As best I can tell, without seeing detailed syllabuses, these advanced courses are slightly above what would be expected in the first year of US PhDs, and the "core," or basic, courses are slightly below. We were all surprised to learn that, in the first cohort of six MPhil/DPhil students last year, all but one chose to take two advanced courses. Now that we've anchored on this, tho, it's unimaginable to take just one at the advanced level. 

My last macro course was in 2015, and crises, business cycles, & monetary policy have never been my passion. Consider also my research of the past year fitting firmly within applied econometrics, and the microeconomics techniques required for development and political economy, this should have made the answer obvious.

But Elodie, the French representative in our cohort, made a convincing argument — the core courses will be large (50+ person) lectures; these are the ones we're most likely to slack on and least likely to engage in classroom discussion and study groups. If I did this with macro, I'd struggle more and learn less; if I was in a large micro course, I'd remain committed due to the material. 

The 2015 Joseph who decided macro "wasn't for him" is long gone — my only major interaction with macro since then was a foray into growth theory{% sidenote "mistak" "Via one of Phil's [dead ends](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zY5FNvbPzQkbf3phj/2-week-summer-course-in-economic-theory-and-global-1#:~:text=global%20public%20goods.-,I%20would%20also%20try%20to%20squeeze%20in%20a%20few%20words%20about%20dead%2Dends%20that%20EA%2Dminded%20econ%20theory%20students%20often%20seem%20to%20wander%20down%20(like%20why%20trying%20to%20understand%20and%20make%20something%20x%2Drisk%2Drelevant%20out%20of%20these%20papers%20is%20a%20waste%20of%20time!) which he enjoys lecturing on.

## Reading 


Will MacAskill's new book, *What We Owe the Future*, came out in late August. He's a moral philosopher, and one of the things we owe the future is moral change. His chief historical example is the abolition of slavery.{% sidenote "mralch" "All of Chapter 3." %}  I've been working through a series of syllabuses on abolition for the past year. I have opinions about how Will wields this example, but my interests lie in a different direction.

## Eating 

I'm interested to see how my eating habits develop in October.

Memorable meals:
- My dad's penchant for authentic Chinese food is well-known. At **Yu Noodles**... profiled in the *Washington Post*... My dad swore by the pickled cabbage; we both liked the spicy dry noodles and were underwhelmed by the soup dumplings; I enjoyed the foon but my chopstick skills weren't quite up to the challenge. 
- **Corado's** in Mt. Pleasant, with Michael Pusic. I met Michael when McKinsey seconded him to the Mayor of Freetown's office; we lived in the same house behind the Chinese embassy for a few months.{% sidenote "bdayw" "Michael also threw me the worst birthday party I've ever had, entirely by accident. People started showing up for the weekly house dinner around 7pm, and I was throwing up from food poisoning by 8pm. " %} This Guatemalan diner is a block or so from his house, and Michael's doing his best to make it a regular haunt. It's a great choice, the chile relleno was perfect and the camarones al corado was the best spicy shrimp dish I've had in DC. But I think Michael's partiality to Corado's is doomed to fail — after tearing through his salad, he spent a few minutes chatting with the waitress in Spanish trying to find a vegetarian starter or entrée. He ended up with an order of chips and pico de gallo.

During September, I spent three Sundays at Bethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad, a volunteer fire department I've been a member of since 2018. Most nights, the ambulances and fire apparatus will go into town to get take out. On Sunday nights, however, we cook. 
Regularly cooking for 15-20 people is a different experience than 

I applied the same strategy in Oxford earlier this month. I moved into my house in Oxford on September 2nd, and we hosted a housewarming party on the 3rd.
