A friend sent me [this](https://copenhagenconsensus.com/halftime-sustainable-development-goals-2016-2030/research) recently:

These are the 12 "best investments" recommended by the Copenhagen Consensus Center for the SDGs. That's just a bit of PR — CC doesn't do much to link these investments to the SDGs directly. 

Here we go:

## Agricultural R&D

The argument is, food is too expensive, and if it were cheaper, fewer people would be hungry. R&D is a public good and therefore underprovided, so governments should step up. The authors give "crop yield increases using precision genetic technolgoies" as an example of a desired intermediate outcome. 

I'm all for cheaper food, but don't think that this research is very underprovided. 

## Childhood immunization

Somewhere we're doing great — and can be doing better! I'm a huge fan. Small cost, huge benefits. 

## Maternal and newborn health

This one's huge. Childbirth is the most common physical trauma in the world — and only two-thirds of births take place in a health facility{% sidenote "mach-id" "is this right? They say 19 million, out of 55 million. Seems low." %} I've been to dozens of these facilities{% sidenote "slrur-id" "There are three levels of rural healthcare facilities in SL, the most common is the MHC, or the maternal healthcare clinic." %} in Sierra Leone, and the default is no electricity, certainly no running water, and a single trained nurse. There's a lot of progress to be made here, not for as cheap as immunizations, but lots of pain and death to avoid. If anything, CC is underselling it.

## e-Government Procurement

Now things get weird.{% sidenote "alpha-id" "We're going alphabetical, so things will get less weird again soon." %} The claim is that poor countries lose a lot to corruption, and instituting online systems will deter or punish much of this. This isn't what the cost-benefit measures; it's more interested in prices for government contracts falling from instituting these systems, 

CC is overselling this one, but sure — net positive. Good luck. 

## Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis is terrible; it kills more people than malaria, typhoid, and cholera combined. 

There's been recent progress. CC's proposal focuses on diagnosis and care, also touching on AMR. Elsewhere, a couple competent of people in my circle have started a new charity, [Spiro](https://www.spiro.ngo/), to work on this problem. In the longer term, [vaccines](https://www.devex.com/news/who-s-jeremy-farrar-says-he-s-optimistic-about-tuberculosis-here-s-why-106241) are in the pipeline. [Here](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/12/13/23998414/tuberculosis-vaccine-m72-human-challenge-trial-volunteers-pandemic)'s Dylan Matthews beating one of his usual drums on the topic of how to move the needle faster and cheaper.

## Nutrition

I was sceptical of this one, but the position paper brought me around. Once the very lowest fruit is picked (mostly, sufficient calories), the global health field is weak at scaling nutrition programs. We have a hard time finding the cheap, effective interventiosn in a field which should be full of easy wins. 

CC's main investment here is to provide micro-nutrients to pregnant women. The paper is vague on this point, but I'm hopeful there are big gains here. Their other recommendation, complementary feeding, attacks the insufficient calories problem. I'm bullish on both of these. 

## Trade

Back to the weird stuff. Specifically, CC calls for reductions in tariffs, reductions in effective distance, and increases in trade agreement depth.

The math works out. The authors of the CC report all have PhDs in economics; three of them are professors focusing exclusively on trade. Of course their model is good.

> Using a structural gravity model, we simulate changes in three primary trade constraints: a 10% reduction in tariff levels, a 10% reduction in effective distance, and a 10% increase in free trade agreement depth. The projection leads to a roughly 5% increase in global trade by value.

There are no arguments in here which would surprise David Ricardo.{% sidenote "ricar-id" "No, he would probably be too distracted by" %} 

It avoids the more delicate cost: the authors don't endogenize the policy change.{% sidenote "espera-id" "Luis with Esperanto." %}

On the margin, yes, let us as world reduce tariffs, improve logistics, write better free trade agreements. But this one doesn't belong in the same category as malaria, TB, or agricultural R&D. 

## Chronic disease

This is a bit of a catch-all for policies aiming to reduce cardiovascular disease, mental illnesses, and some cancers. CC's recommendations in this category range from tobacco excise taxes{% sidenote "concentr-id" "A friend, JT Stanley, has recently started [a charity ](https://www.concentricpolicies.org/) to address this one." %} to "aspirin for suspected heart attacks."{% sidenote "apir-id" "Cool? Yeah, this is the entirety of the recommendation. I don't think doctors in poor countries haven't heard of NSAIDs, and it's not at all clear to me how the authors calculate the costs or counterfactual benefits of this one. " %} Overall, the eight recommendations they make are all good ones, but the quantification here is weak, especially for the clinical recommendations.{% sidenote "eight-id" "OK the authors say in the subtitle that they have eight recommended interventions, but in the body of the [paper](https://copenhagenconsensus.com/publication/halftime-sdgs-chronic-diseases), they mention subsets of five, thirteen, ten, and fifteen interventions which pass their bar in various scenarios. $10 to anyone who can figure out which eight the subtitle refers to. " %}


## Land tenure security

This is an interesting one, and should have much bigger error bars than anything else on this list. The recommendations are a) create land registries, b) create institutions to improve efficiency and transparency, and c) "strengthen institutions and systems to resolve land disputes and manage expropriations." The benefits claimed in the table are impressive:{% sidenote "extr-id" "I can vent frustration in the sidenotes, right? Right. The numbers in the table show up *nowhere* in the paper which supposedly came up with those numbers. The numbers in the paper are close enough that I don't think Bjørn Lomborg (whom we're not discussing in this post) pulled them out of his butt but... come on dude." %} 4x the benefits of e-procurement systems, mostly through increased agricultural output and land values. 

Quick thoughts:
- -I'm sceptical of their cost estimates, like an OOM sceptical. 
- -You think regulatory capture is bad in your rich, WEIRD culture? Try to reinvent cadastry in states which have had two successful coups *in the past year*{% sidenote "bfas-id" "Burkina Faso is one of the authors' primary examples." %} or doesn't know, within a factor of 2, [how many people they have](https://www.ft.com/content/5a1a8d10-d2cd-4467-b877-06146cdb48e1). Any land registration system will allow the people who can afford lawyers to take land from the people who can't read — especially in countries with weak rule of law.
- -That's two pessimistic; here's one in the other direction: you can't tax you don't know exists. Poor countries' inability to raise revenue is the origin of much woe, and land taxes are the simplest and most efficient tax mechanism available. 

## Malaria

AMF should never have a [funding shortfall](https://www.againstmalaria.com/AMFFundingGap.aspx) ever again. Out of [spite](https://ourworldindata.org/malaria).

## Skilled migration

Read [Weinersmith](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316960). And, as with trade, endogenize the policy change.

## Education

This is the most expensive, and ambitious, intervention on the list. Based on nothing but the title, my take was: 

1. 1 Identifying effective education interventions is hard,
2. 2 Scaling them is harder, 
3. 3 Costs are higher than modeled,
4. 4 Benefits are smaller than modeled.{% sidenote "parall-id" "This last could be better written as 'benefits fade faster than expected,' but that's not parallel." %} 

I read the policy paper, and [did not change my mind](https://jablevine.com/assets/img/keynes.webp). The authors' two recommended interventions are "structured pedagogy" and "teaching to the right level." The details of these don't matter, because my priors (refer to 1-4 above) are robust to any combination of teacher-time, scheduled text reminders, and lesson plans. The idea that we could cut $100 billion in education spending, replace that with  ten billion *better spent* dollars, and reap half of a trillion in benefits *per year*... Well, there's only one [trillion dollar bill](https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.25.3.83) on this list, and this isn't it. 

# Conclusion

That's that. Copenhagen Consensus put together a good list, even if my snideness got away from me at times.
