### Monthly Le Guin

*[She Unnames Them](https://archives.newyorker.com/newyorker/1985-01-21/flipbook/026)* was published in the New Yorker in 1985. The story jumps off from Genesis 2:19:

> 19 Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 20 So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.

## Listening

Some favorites. This month, [Finn's list](https://finmoorhouse.com/writing/media-2022-b/#music) provided the most new listening material. 

- •*The Abduction from the Seraglio*, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt. A very energetic recording. I don't have the patience to listen to opera straight through (even *Hamilton* took me three sessions my first listen through). This recording sounds stately & classical{% sidenote "clashar-id" "In some non-ironic sense." %} without dragging. If only my attention span could hold up to operatic standards. 
- •*Welcome 2 America*, Prince. The first posthumous Prince album; very political and funkily infectious. Prince is not usually  on my must-listens (I couldn't name more than a few of his *40 albums*), but this is a re-listen.
- •*El Arte Del Bolero*, Miguel Zenón & Luis Perdomo. 
- •*50 Years of Funk & Soul: Live at the Fox Theater*, Tower of Power.{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "H/T Emma." %} Ooh this was good. 
- •*Renaissance*, Apashe.{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "H/T Sam." %} Not my usual stuff. Thanks to the #music channel on the work Slack.
- •*La Grande Folie*, San Salvador. French a capella with the intensity of the *Kill Bill* theme music.
