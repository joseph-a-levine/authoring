## Reading 

Especially good books I read last month: 

- •"Computing taste: algorithms and the makers of music recommendation." 
- •"A primate's memoir: a neuroscientist's unconventional life among the baboons",
- •"Arguing about justice: essays for Philippe Van Parijs",
- •"The war that doesn't say its name: the unending conflict in the Congo", by Jason Stearns. I wish there were more books like this. The Congolese Civil War{% sidenote "wikieconciv-id" "Which is Not A Thing, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congolese_Civil_War)" %} has been on-going since before I was born; how do we explain decades of low-level fighting? Continued fighting is in no-one's interest, but governments, rebels, and international organizations continue to instigate. The role of Rwanda in egging on the conflict is particularly egregious. The book has is based on years of field work in eastern Congo{% sidenote "kivfie-id" "Gosh I'm jealous." %} and has strong theoretical grounding. Stearns outs himself as a constructivist early on and I was immediately thrown back to my single year of international relations lectures at St Andrews. 
- •The most important thing I read this month were Joe Carlsmith's essays on doing ethics as an anti-realist. I've been calling myself an anti-realist total utilitarian to anyone who asks{% sidenote "attotaut-id" "Not many people." %} since at least 2017, and it wasn't until that I really confronted this. The impetus

### Monthly Le Guin

*[She Unnames Them](https://archives.newyorker.com/newyorker/1985-01-21/flipbook/026)* ([pdf](https://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Mail/xmcamail.2013_01.dir/pdf4gQ1dofjT0.pdf)) was published in the New Yorker in 1985.{% sidenote "htmor-id" "H/T ML." %} The story jumps off from Genesis 2:19:

> 19 Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 20 So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.

And the eponymous She is Eve. Gender and language are central; the philosophy is classical Le Guin throughout — "the issue was precisely one of individual choice, and that anybody who wanted to be called Rover, or Froufrou, or Polly, or even Birdie in the personal sense, was perfectly free to do so." Le Guin has few other forays with biblical themes; tho other works do touch on religious concepts, including *The Word for World Is Forest*, which includes themes of spiritualism and environmentalism, and "The Telling," dealing with an alien but repressive religious culture.

The story is short, less than a page, so I don't feel bad about spoiling it. Eve goes to Adam, and returns that which him and his father lent to her. Even 80s Le Guin can't help sounding sarcastic when she writes: 

> It is hard to give back a gift without sounding peevish or ungrateful, and I did not want to leave him with that impression of me. He was not paying much attention, as it happened, and said only, "Put it down over there, O.K.?" and went on with what he was doing.

## Listening

Some favorites. This month, [Finn's list](https://finmoorhouse.com/writing/media-2022-b/#music) provided the most new listening material. 

- •*The Abduction from the Seraglio*, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt. A very energetic recording. I don't have the patience to listen to opera straight through (even *Hamilton* took me three sessions my first listen through). This recording sounds stately & classical{% sidenote "clashar-id" "In some non-ironic sense." %} without dragging. If only my attention span could hold up to operatic standards. 
- •*Welcome 2 America*, Prince. The first posthumous Prince album; very political and funkily infectious. Prince is not usually  on my must-listens (I couldn't name more than a few of his *40 albums*), but this is a re-listen.
- •*El Arte Del Bolero*, Miguel Zenón & Luis Perdomo. 
- •*50 Years of Funk & Soul: Live at the Fox Theater*, Tower of Power.{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "H/T Emma." %} Ooh this was good. 
- •*Renaissance*, Apashe.{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "H/T Sam." %} Not my usual stuff. Thanks to the #music channel on the work Slack.
- •*La Grande Folie*, San Salvador. French a capella with the intensity of the *Kill Bill* theme music.
