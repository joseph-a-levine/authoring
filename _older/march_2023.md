## March, 2023

I'll be in Oxford throughout this month, as revision begins to heat up for the April mega-exams. These three exams — [micro, macro, metrics](https://jablevine.com/older/october_2022) — are the most important procedural requirement for my PhD program. The bar is quite low — we only need to secure a Pass to move on, and everyone in the first class passed last year. None of us know, nor have the courage to ask, what happens if we don't pass one of the exams. 

In once sense, I haven't studied for an exam since 2018; in a much more real sense, I haven't studied for an exam ever.{% sidenote "actstud-id" "I probably studied most intensely for the GRE, which I found wholly unrewarding." %} My strategies at the moment are rather scattershot — I make Anki decks, I ask ChatGPT to prove the Bondareva-Shapley theorem using linear programming, I pester Qingyu until he explains LASSO estimators — 

Going through old material, ChatGPT has become embarrassingly invaluable. In lecture, I have a crippling inability to ask stupid questions, which can leave me floundering.{% sidenote "sumbclaqu-id" "Sure, maybe no one else knows what it means for a cooperative game to be 'balanced,' but *they're* not asking, so I must be the dumb one. Better just stay quiet." %} But ChatGPT can't judge! I've taken to keeping a ChatGPT tab open in lecture alongside the slides, and asking it about points of confusion.{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "It's helpful to ask ChatGPT to keep its responses shorter. Also, it writes very good quality LaTeX." %} Then, after a lecture, I'll review my conversation and use it to fill in my notes. Last term, if I was confused about a definition or step in a proof, I'd mark the slide and come back to it later. 

Out of some masochistic curiosity, I pasted a recent problem set into ChatGPT

## Reading 

Especially-good books I read in February: 

- •"[Computing taste: algorithms and the makers of music recommendation](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Computing-Taste-Algorithms-Makers-Recommendation/dp/0226822974)," by Nick Seaver. I don't know who Kevin Baker is, and I don't remember subscribing to [his newsletter](https://kevinbaker.substack.com/p/irregex-20230213), but the recommendations are consistently top-notch. Kevin recommended "Computing Taste," and I downloaded it off of the strength of the title. It's a sociologist's take on companies which sell music recommendation algorithms, with digressions into the history of music recommendation and more interesting technical problems. Of niche interest. 
- •"[A primate's memoir: a neuroscientist's unconventional life among the baboons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Primate%27s_Memoir)", by Robert Sapolsky. A mix between a neuroscientist's fieldwork memoir and a critical look at the sociology of baboons. Despite Sapolsky's excellent raconteur-age, I ended up skipping more and more of the memoir chapters towards the end.{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "This is a random sidenote" %} The baboons steal the show — I was both thrilled and saddened to learn that the species in the book is of Least Concern conservation status, and are considered pests even by primatologists. Sapolsky's passion for the animals is infectious; one reviewer wrote that "it’s hard not to love what he loves, when he loves so well." Despite this, baboons continue to... suck? They take all the petty aggression of humanity and turn it to 10, with just enough of the good qualities necessary to sustain a somewhat functioning society. Loveable nonetheless.
- •"[Arguing about justice: essays for Philippe Van Parijs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Arguing-about-justice-Philippe-collections-ebook/dp/B00HAKHOQ6)", collection. This book was intended as a birthday present for Van Parijs from his academic friends, a Belgian political theorist most associated with UBI. I downloaded it to get a single essay, titled "If Marx or Freud had never lived?" Then I got sucked in by the table of contents. Other highlights included "Why has Cuban state socialism escaped its 1989? Reflections on a non-event;" "Love not war. On the chemistry of good and evil;" and "Lamentation in the face of historical necessity." 
- •"[The war that doesn't say its name: the unending conflict in the Congo](https://www.amazon.co.uk/War-That-Doesnt-Say-Name/dp/0691194084)", by Jason Stearns. I wish there were more books like this. The Congolese Civil War{% sidenote "wikieconciv-id" "Which is Not A Thing, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congolese_Civil_War)" %} has been on-going since before I was born; how do we explain decades of low-level fighting? Continued fighting is in no-one's interest, but governments, rebels, and international organizations continue to instigate. The role of Rwanda in egging on the conflict is particularly egregious. The book has is based on years of field work in eastern Congo{% sidenote "kivfie-id" "Gosh I'm jealous." %} and has strong theoretical grounding. Stearns outs himself as a constructivist early on and I was immediately thrown back to my single year of international relations lectures at St Andrews. 
- •The most important thing I read this month were Joe Carlsmith's essays on doing ethics as an anti-realist ([1](https://joecarlsmith.com/2023/02/16/why-should-ethical-anti-realists-do-ethics), 2). I've been calling myself an anti-realist total utilitarian to anyone who asks{% sidenote "attotaut-id" "Not many people." %} since at least 2017; given the anti-realist part of that identity, the total utilitarian part was merely an aesthetic preference. 

### Monthly Le Guin

*[She Unnames Them](https://archives.newyorker.com/newyorker/1985-01-21/flipbook/026)* ([pdf](https://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Mail/xmcamail.2013_01.dir/pdf4gQ1dofjT0.pdf)) was published in the New Yorker in 1985.{% sidenote "htmor-id" "H/T ML." %} The story jumps off from Genesis 2:19:

> 19 Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 20 So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.

And the eponymous She is Eve. Gender and language are central; the philosophy is classical Le Guin throughout — "the issue was precisely one of individual choice, and that anybody who wanted to be called Rover, or Froufrou, or Polly, or even Birdie in the personal sense, was perfectly free to do so." Le Guin has few other forays with biblical themes; tho other works do touch on religious concepts, including *The Word for World Is Forest*, which includes themes of spiritualism and environmentalism, and "The Telling," dealing with an alien but repressive religious culture.

The story is short, less than a page, so I don't feel bad about spoiling it. Eve goes to Adam, and returns that which him and his father lent to her. Even 80s Le Guin can't help sounding sarcastic when she writes: 

> It is hard to give back a gift without sounding peevish or ungrateful, and I did not want to leave him with that impression of me. He was not paying much attention, as it happened, and said only, "Put it down over there, O.K.?" and went on with what he was doing.


## Eating

Lots of smoothies and tofu (not at the same time). I made pancakes three times in February, which felt like too few. I miss Mexican food.
