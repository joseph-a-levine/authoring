Typhoid and the Widal test

Despite being different diseases (how), in German, "typhus" means both typhoid and typhus.

I've been living in Freetown, Sierra Leone, since January. Life here is idyllic, if your version of idyllic allows for daily power outages, the occasional dog bite, and a rooster outside your window at 4:50am{% marginfigure "margin-figure-id" "assets/img/dennis.jpg" "This is Dennis. It's not clear why Dennis lives here, as we have no chickens." %}. My favorite things about this city are the fresh pineapple, the view from my balcony the morning after a rainstorm, and the row of bars{% sidenote "smoothie" "Smoothie and otherwise" %} along the beach.

{% marginnote "physical" "*Physical books*" %}<a name="physical"></a>Along with my Kindle, I brought three books with me to Freetown: Whitman's "Leaves of Grass", FitzGerald's "Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyam", and "Open Borders". The last, a work of graphic non-fiction,{% sidenote "graphic" "An unfortunate name for the genre, I think. But nothing better has been proposed." %} is only available in paperback. It's one of those books you buy knowing you'll agree with it completely, but read closely anyway. Bryan Caplan provided the economics and <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20130404.gif">Zach Weinersmith</a> provided the illustrations (including delightful caricatures of Michael Clemens and George Borjas). The format makes it difficult to excerpt but easy to enjoy. 

As for the other two books, I've never been able too bring myself to read poetry on a laptop or e-reader. For long poems, there's something visceral about turning a paper page that maintains the flow of the verse which tapping a kindle screen can't replicate. For anthologies of short poems, like the Rubáiyát, the serendipity of stumbling upon any poem in particular is replaced by a linear progression through the four-line enigmas. There's no "random page" button on a kindle. 

Besides these three books, everything else I've read since arriving has been electronic. 

Some books are classics despite their length; others are classics because of it. {% marginnote "gibb" "<a name="gibb">*<q>History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,</q> Edward Gibbons*</a>" %}Gibbons' "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" is in the second category. I haven't read it, and I don't plan to, but the six-volume work has fascinated me from a distance. 

While I haven't read "Decline and Fall," I did read Alvaro de Menard's 25,000 [word](https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/04/28/book-review-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire/) [review](https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/05/03/highlights-from-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire/). 

"Decline and Fall" is both literary and academic. The language is important: Menard calls it "monumental, active, Latinate, flamboyant, often epigrammatic." It's *fun* to read someone who's so good at putting sentences together: 
> Gibbon's sentences are long and balanced; his thought is dualistic and symmetrical, often based on comparisons or parallels between actions, characters, wars, and ages. He loves to expose contradictions within characters: Augustus is "at first the enemy, and at last the father" of Rome. He often goes for striking antitheses and juxtapositions, methods which allow him to instruct, pass judgment, and most importantly display the decline of the empire: he plays the old against the new, the particular against the general, the ideal against the pragmatic.

But epic language only matches epic events. **Spectacle** is what makes "Decline and Fall" what it is: the word recurs throughout Menard's review, and Borges' as well. 

A decadent empire requires decadent emperors. But Gibbons isn't given to psychoanalysis. The closest we get to Gibbons' characters is through his dunks: 
> [Julian] was assisted by the eloquent Mamertinus, one of the consuls elect, whose merit is loudly celebrated by the doubtful evidence of his own applause.
Or:
> [On the historian Gregory of Tours] His style is equally devoid of elegance and simplicity. In a conspicuous station he still remained a stranger to his own age and country; and in a prolix work (the five last books contain ten years) he has omitted almost everything that posterity desires to learn. I have tediously acquired, by a painful perusal, the right of pronouncing this unfavourable sentence.

Gibbons' focus on Roman decadence doesn't give him an opportunity to focus on the [Good Emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerva%E2%80%93Antonine_dynasty#Five_Good_Emperors). I was reading "Memoirs of Hadrian"{% marginnote "hadrian" "<a name="gibb">*<q>Memoirs of Hadrian,</q> Marguerite Yourcenar*</a>" %} at the same time 

What was Yourcenar's theory of the Good Emperor Hadrian? In his own words, "my greatest asset of all was perfect health: a forced march of twenty leagues was nothing; a night without sleep was no more than a chance to think in peace. Few men enjoy prolonged travel; it disrupts all habit and endlessly jolts each prejudice." Ezra Klein said somewhere that one of the most important skills for a modern CEO was the ability to get restful sleep on an international flight. A certain type of endurance enables swift governance, and Hadrian spent more time away from Rome than any peacetime Emperor in history. He continued his travels almost until his death. 

A year or two ago, I couldn't define "decadent" past a slice of chocolate cake. If pressed, I might have made a connection to the baroque, but the "luxury" part of the definition was more salient than the "decline" part. [Ross Douthat](https://www.amazon.com/Decadent-Society-Became-Victims-Success/dp/1476785244){% sidenote "nyt" "With an NYT column. The irony must be purposeful." %} is mostly responsible for the resurgence of the word, but Thiel and Cowen's great stagnation (now [over](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/11/is-the-great-stagnation-over.html)?) should receive some credit as well. 

"Decline and Fall" is the defining work of decadence. Gibbons was obsessed with the idea, and not just in Rome: alongside Burke, he watched the Bourbons fall with revulsion, and feared the American Revolution presaged a similar disaster in Britain. Eric Ambler's opinion was that, "in a dying civilization, political prestige is the reward not of the shrewdest diagnostician but of the man with the best bedside manner." Prætorians have this bedside matter, so did Pitt the Younger (any of Louis' ministers). Hadrian did not. 

As hard as I look, I don't see any of Gibbon's decadence in Douthat's and Thiel's complaints about America today. Here's a fun (and representative) listicle, "[A list of ten ways we are decadent](https://itsonlychemo.wordpress.com/2020/02/17/a-list-of-ten-simple-ways-we-are-decadent-and-a-speculative-theory-about-why-it-might-not-matter/)." My summary:
1. “Go into a room and subtract off all the screens. How do you then know you’re not in 1973?”
2. Falling birth rates
3. Culture - movies remakes are increasing
4. IQ is falling, reverse Flynn effect
5. Labor productivity has stalled
6. Growth is underperfomring since 2008
7. Growth of populism
8. Death of middle class jobs
9. Housing is too expensive
10. Culture - books and authors are boring and homogeneous



I also read some books unrelated to decadence recently. 

On my second read, "Persuasion"{% marginnote "pers" "<a name="persuasion">*<q>Persuasion,</q> Jane Austen*</a>" %} is still my favorite Jane Austen novel. That said, I picked it up again expecting more value from the more mature characters{% sidenote "mature" "Relative to <q>Pride and Prejudice</q> or <q>Emma</q>, my sister's favorite." %} than I found at 18 years old. The maturity arrived; the value didn't. I probably enjoyed "Persuasion" more at 18 because of my (since-faded) familiarity with the Napoleonic wars. Wentworth made more sense in that context. 

The short stories in Egan's collection "Axiomatic"{% marginnote "axio" "<a name="axiom">*<q>Axiomatic,</q> Greg Egan*</a>" %} punch you in the face, over and over again. Ted Chiang is the only modern sci-fi anthologist in his league, but Egan's science is much harder and his fiction is much more personal. Even the economics in the story are rewarding — American health insurance is a key plot element in two stories. I was reminded more of *The Twilight Zone* than *Black Mirror* in tone, but not for lack of trying on my part. 

The stories are also the most deeply *conservative* new-wave science-fiction I've read, in a [G.A. Cohen](https://jablevine.com/assets/papers/cohen_conservatism_2004.pdf) sense. 


## Listening <a name="music"></a>

[Works in Progress](https://worksinprogress.co/), a recently-founded online magazine on progress studies, featured an essay by Ryan Murphy on "[peak culture](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/this-is-what-peak-culture-looks-like/)" in May. Murphy argues that newer culture, "film, art, music, and literature", is *better* culture. 

> How do we know this means that the modern world is better? Because people don’t just copy and paste. All of these incredible works of the past are just sitting there waiting for you to enjoy them (with 80% or more of the impact of experiencing the original in real life) on YouTube, your local library, or Google Images. Instead, we choose to experience other things. Economists have a phrase for this: revealed preference. Our revealed preferences mean something, and it ought to be a baseline assumption, if nothing else, that if we are making the choice for one thing over another it’s because it’s better for us. To recapitulate: in a given field of art or practice, if we can replicate a near approximation of a historical masterwork at a cost no higher than it was in the past, and we’re doing something else, that something else is probably better than the supposed historical masterwork.

I mostly read old books, and so do a [lot](https://tommycollison.com/greatbooks) [of](https://d101vc9winf8ln.cloudfront.net/documents/28231/original/Favorite_Books.pdf?1527190190) [people](https://interintellect.com/series/reading-the-greats/), so an argument from revealed preferences doesn't get anywhere for literature. But I listen to plenty of new music, and Murphy's "near approximation" thesis proves too much. Just because we could approxi

My sisters were roasting me for not having listened to Olivia Rodrigo's "Good 4 You."{% marginfigure "gh_rodrigo" "assets/img/gh_rodrigo.png" "" %} So, as I do a few times a year, I went and listened to the US Top 50 playlist on Spotify. Only four of the songs{% sidenote "90songs" "<q>Good 4 You,</q> <q>Heat Waves,</q> <q>Blinding Lights,</q> and <q>Forever After All.</q> Even <q>Forever After All</q>, though, is solidly 2010s pop country music, and only included because of Luke Combs' style." %} sounded even remotely like anything I've heard from before 2000. Of the fifty songs, only the purposefully lo-fi songs like Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo's acoustic versions could have been approximated before the 1970s.
