## Updates

The middle third of February was spent in Mexico City with MWG, my sister, and other loved ones. 

Notably, I've now made three (haphazard, half-hearted) attempts to climb Nevado de Toluca, and failed all three times. 

## Reading

One part of my thesis involved a ton of reading, thankfully. Over a 36 hour period last week, I read at least the abstract of every development paper{% sidenote "jelfcod-id" By JEL code." %} published in the top 5 economics journals since 2016. Some cool ones jumped out.{% sidenote "sidenote-id" This is a random sidenote" %}  


### I &lt;3 David Roodman

David Roodman is the development+meta-science GOAT. I read his book on microfinance in 2016 and have been smitten ever since. He's currently at Open Philanthropy, but has been freelance for much of his career, casually dismantling large sectors of development economics as flawed, pointless, or both, and building it back up stronger. 

Trying to find one paper from a top journal, the the second result (props to Google) was a 50 page "[Comment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13694.pdf)" on that paper by Roodman. 

> The paper finds positive impacts on individual- and firm-level employment and nighttime light emissions. These results are largely ascribable to geocoding errors; to discontinuities from a satellite changeover at end-2009; and to a definition of the treated zone that has unclear technological basis, is narrower than the spatial resolution of nearly all the data sources, and is weakly representative of the geography of broadband availability.

Also props to the authors of the original paper: he gave all his code and data to Roodman, and had feedback on the comment.

Everything on Roodman's Arxiv profile is golden. Four smackdowns — i.e., should not have been published. One surface-level inspection of an important question, the fertility effects of development programs. Then an attempt to be Correct about immigration, alcohol taxes, and crime.

The effect of reading Roodman is to become less confident in any individual piece of published research, but more confident in fields. Take [this review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10268.pdf) on the impacts of incarceration on crime. He attempted to replicate eight studies (of three dozen), and "revealed significant methodological concerns in seven and led to major reinterpretations of four." Despite this, the meta, common-sense result that incarceration stops people from committing crime while in prison while increasing the amount of crime they commit after release holds. 

### Updates on cash transfers

I have a recent [post](https://jablevine.com/articles/23/cash-benchmarking-attenuation) about why we might expect traditional development programs (those which provide training, or goods, or some other complex program to poor people) to be advantaged compared to programs which give cash in the longer term. A friend who reviewed it, DB, suggested thinking about thinking about this in terms of cash vs. in-kind transfers. I finally got around to reading the most important empirical paper on this topic: [Cunha et al.](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr735.pdf) in ReStud, which looks at a Mexican program which provided cash or cost-equivalent food bundles to rural villages.

Their focus is the differential price effects of these interventions: do bundles of food reduce the price of those food items in these villages? Do cash transfers push up prices for all goods?

> We find that prices are significantly lower under in-kind transfers compared with cash transfers; relative to the control group, in-kind transfers lead to a 4 percent fall in prices while cash transfers lead to a positive but negligible increase in prices. Prices of goods other than those transferred are also affected, but by a small amount.
> ..
> The effects do not dissipate over the two years of program duration we observe.

I come away unfazed.  This looks like a boring "rural prices are sticky downwards" finding on both the cash and in-kind side. 


In the past 36 hours, I've read the abstract of every development paper published in the top 5 econ journals since 2016. I've been moving pretty fast (I'm coding stuff for my thesis) but some really cool ones jumped out at me. 




- [This next one](https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/99423/7/WRAP-early-life-circumstance-adult-mental-health-Fenske-2018.pdf) is a bit more niche — the authors found a region (Ghana) very dependent on a single commodity (cocoa) and tracked how adult mental health is affected by fluctuations in the price of that commodity when people were kids. Effect sizes are big, but only because cocoa is the most volatile 20th century, nationally-dependent commodity I can think of. It's also a lot more difficult to store. Interesting, not confident it'll generalize. The attribute the effect to lowered nutrition, lowered education investment, and "adult circumstance", which they never define. 

- [This paper](https://ftrebbi.com/research/TW.pdf) is somewhat interesting, in using standard panel econometrics to try to identify networks among insurgent groups. I'm including it here because I might use it for my machine learning proposal.

### Other reading

I'm about two-thirds through a memoir by the webmaster of the largest harry potter fansite, covering 2003-2007, the last three books. It's not a good book, but it's a great story. Of course, the author is a massive Harry Potter fan, but the level of infection to the pop culture milieu shines through. It's a bit of an authorized history (Rowling and the publishers all sat down for interviews) but more revealing for that, as long as you remember. The author has disavowed Rowling very strongly since the trans stuff. Also, the Spartz's (the Nonlinear ones) keep showing up in the book; it is a small world. 

I have a memory of being in middle school, and getting called to the principal's office because my dad was there. Apparently I had hidden a book which had *just* gotten released from my sisters, so that *I* could finish it before they did; I guess my parents hadn't wanted to buy more than one book and overestimated my sharing abilities. He had driven all the way to school to scold me and make me tell him where the book was hidden, so my sisters could read it. It couldn't have been Harry Potter (I started middle school the same year book 7 was released, but it came out during summer vacation), so I'm not sure what book was. But I do remember being infected by the mania that book releases had in the 2000s. According to the Harry Potter book, that wasn't a thing before Harry Potter, and it certainly hasn't been a thing since. Now *there's* a secular religion if there ever was one.
