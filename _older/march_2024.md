## Updates

The middle third of February was spent in Mexico City with MWG, my sister, and other loved ones. 

Notably, I've now made three (haphazard, half-hearted) attempts to climb Nevado de Toluca, and failed all three times. 

## Reading


In the past 36 hours, I've read the abstract of every development paper published in the top 5 econ journals since 2016. I've been moving pretty fast (I'm coding stuff for my thesis) but some really cool ones jumped out at me. 

 - Do you know who David Roodman is? He's the development+meta-science GOAT. He's currently at OpenPhil but has been freelance for most of his career, casually dismantling large sectors of development economics as flawed, pointless, or fraudulent. When I googled one of the papers in a top journal, the second result (props to Google) was a 50 page "Comment" on that paper by Roodman. [Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13694.pdf). "The paper finds positive impacts on individual- and firm-level employment and nighttime light emissions. These results are largely ascribable to geocoding errors; to discontinuities from a satellite changeover at end-2009; and to a definition of the treated zone that has unclear technological basis, is narrower than the spatial resolution of nearly all the data sources, and is weakly representative of the geography of broadband availability."
	 - Props to the original paper's author — he gave all his code and data to Roodman, and had feedback on the comment. But this is just a casual side-project for Roodman. What a man.
- I was complaining to you recently that there isn't enough good work on Rwandan domestic politics — the particular mechanism which annoys me is the same as Singapore, which is that the government doesn't encourage (and to different extents, discourages) locally-based academics to write on their own context. Here's [an econ paper]([https://doi.org/10.1086/701441](https://doi.org/10.1086/701441)) which scratched that itch. 
	- It uses a familiar IV (radio waves don't go around mountains) which I've been sceptical of for a while — the first use was on American intergration in the Appalachians, but now it's feeling overused. I still trust it, but not as much as I'd like. 
	- I suspect there are great papers on domestic Rwandan politics in other fields which I'm missing. Pointers appreciated.
	- Also uses pencil sketches well (see page 17 of the published version).
- [This next one](https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/99423/7/WRAP-early-life-circumstance-adult-mental-health-Fenske-2018.pdf) is a bit more niche — the authors found a region (Ghana) very dependent on a single commodity (cocoa) and tracked how adult mental health is affected by fluctuations in the price of that commodity when people were kids. Effect sizes are big, but only because cocoa is the most volatile 20th century, nationally-dependent commodity I can think of. It's also a lot more difficult to store. Interesting, not confident it'll generalize. The attribute the effect to lowered nutrition, lowered education investment, and "adult circumstance", which they never define. 
- [This one](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr735.pdf)'s relevant to a blog post (of mine) I sent you a couple months ago; somehow I missed it at the time. They do  a cool experiment with three arms, control, cash treatment, cash-equivalent food treatment, and look at the general equilibrium effects. It's annoying how *directly* this answers my question from that post.
- [This paper](https://ftrebbi.com/research/TW.pdf) is somewhat interesting, in using standard panel econometrics to try to identify networks among insurgent groups. I'm including it here because I might use it for my machine learning proposal.
- Finally, I found that [[Dennis Egger]] [pre-registered](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/12550) his new [[Malawi]] project which he has so far REFUSED to give me details about (not really, he just kept saying it wasn't ready yet). I should read this before our next meeting so I can talk him into letting me go to Malawi. 

### Updates on cash transfers

I have a recent (post)[https://jablevine.com/articles/23/cash-benchmarking-attenuation] about why we might expect traditional development programs (those which provide training, or goods, or some other complex program to poor people) to be advantaged compared to programs which give cash in the longer term. A friend who reviewed it, DB, suggested thinking about thinking about this in terms of cash vs. in-kind transfers. I finally got around to reading the most important empirical paper on this topic: (Cunha et al.)[https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr735.pdf] in ReStud, which looks at a Mexican program which provided cash or cost-equivalent food bundles to rural villages.

Their focus is the differential price effects of these interventions: do bundles of food reduce the price of those food items in these villages? Do cash transfers push up prices for all goods?

> We find that prices are significantly lower under in-kind transfers compared with cash transfers; relative to the control group, in-kind transfers lead to a 4 percent fall in prices while cash transfers lead to a positive but negligible increase in prices. Prices of goods other than those transferred are also affected, but by a small amount.
> ..
> The effects do not dissipate over the two years of program duration we observe.

I come away unfazed.  This looks like a boring "rural prices are sticky downwards" finding on both the cash and in-kind side.
