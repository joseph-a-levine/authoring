title: Books I read in 2024
---

This is a list of the books I read in 2024. ★ means I loved it; ⟳ is a re-read.

The books are in reverse order of when I put them into Zotero; I read some books right away, while others waited around for five or ten months until the time was right. 

————————————————

***A Peace to End All Peace: Creating the Modern Middle East 1914-1922***, **David Fromkin**. A history of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, waning and fumbling British influence, and a lot of Churchill. A strong book on WWI as well.  

***The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millenium***, **Martin Gurri**. An early exploration of the digital revolution and the transition of social power.

★***The Golden Mole and Other Living Treasures***, **Katherine Rundell**. A collection of Rundell's LRB columns on animals; I read aloud to MWG on Whatsapp audio messages.

***The Marriage Portrait***, **Maggie O'Farrell**. A novel about the short life of Lucrezia de'Medici; death hangs over the entire novel but in my memory it was cheerful and hopeful regardless?

***Orkney***, **Amy Sackville**. A novel; I'm a sucker for an unreliable narrator but this might have gone too far. Beautiful setting.

***Affordable Excellence: The Singapore Healthcare Story***, **William A. Haseltine**. Excellent, short, delivers on the title. The importance of initial conditions. Import more doctors. They take induced demand very seriously. None of this matters if they can't get fertility up.

★***Here***, **Richard McGuire**. The best visual art of the year? The importance of continuity.

***Call to Arms***, **L.U. Xun**. A seminal short story collection, critiques of early 20th century Chinese society. 

***The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect***, **Roger Williams**. A 1994 controversial sci-fi novel about alignment. Not very deep; very fun. 

***Haig's Enemy: Crown Prince Rupprecht and Germany's War on the Western Front***, **Jonathan Boff**. A biography of Rupprecht -- Haig is absent. This was a good WWI year for me, largely kicked off by this book. 

★***Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory, and the Conquest of Everest***, **Wade Davis**. This book couldn't quite decide what it wanted to be, alternating between a biography of Mallory, a meditation on psychological effects of the Western Front, a mountaineering guide, and a collection of essays. It really comes together.

***A Countess Below Stairs***, **Eva Ibbotson**. An early but very modern romance novel. A Russian countess flees the revolution to England, where she works as a maid in a Duke's household. You can guess the rest of the plot. Ibbotson (of *Which Witch?* fame) is always worth reading.

***Cosmicomics***, **Italo Calvino**. A collection of sci-fi tales, fun and whimsical, with depth.

***The Canadian Contribution to a Comparative Law of Secession: Legacies of the Quebec Secession Reference***, **ed. Giacomo Delledonne and Guiseppe Martinico**. An academic volume on the 1998 Supreme Court of Canada Reference on the sucession of Quebec, looking at influences on global constitutional theory and practice. I intended to read just one essay, but this was really good! 

***Chaucer***, **G.K. Chesterton**. A literary biography; the theology goes over my head. That's OK: Chesterton wasn't only a Christian apologist. The man is an apologist for much else: modernism, bureaucracy, incrementalism, and a certain type of aesthetic hedonism. Chaucer is the lens he uses here.

***So Far So Good***, **Ursula K. Le Guin**. A late collection of her poetry.

***The Fever: How Malaria Has Ruled Humankind for 500,000 Years***, **Sonia Shah**. Not Great.

***At Night All Blood is Black***, **David Diop**. A novel about a Senegalese soldier fighting for France in WWI. Violence, colonialism, racism, madness. 

***The Morning Gift***, **Eva Ibbotson**. Similar to ***A Countess Below Stairs***, also focused on refugees, more of a memoir of Ibbotson's own life. 

***High Adventure***, **Edmund Hillary**. A story of his early life, and the conquest of Everest. There's a reason we have ghost writers today.

***Coronation Everest***, **Jan Morris**. The story of the conquest of Everest -- by the professional writer they brought along! Morris is one of my favorite writers, and I didn't know she was on the 1953 expedition until I came across this book. 

***The Lost Explorer: Finding Mallory on Mount Everest***, **Conrad Anger and David Roberts**. Details on a 1999 expedition to recover George Mallory's body; no insight into the question of whether he reached the summit.

***The Black Box: Cocpit Voice Recorder Accounts***, **Malcolm J. McPherson**. Fine, but just read Cloudberg.

***The World Through Blunted Sight: An INquiry into the Influence of Defective Vision on Art and Character***, **Patrick Trevor-Roper**. An exploration of how visual impairments influenced their work. I thought it was the other Trevor-Ropert.

***The Guns of the South***, **Harry Turtledove**. A novel of alternate history; Robert E. Lee gets Kalishnikovs. 

***The Animal That Therefore I Am***, **Jacques Derrida**. Continental philosophy on our relationship with animals. Our understanding of ourselves is imperiled by how we view and relate to animals.

***The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure***, **William Goldman**. Read outloud to MWG over Whatsapp audio messages.

***Carrying the Fire***, **Michal Collis**. A memoir of a full life and a trip to the moon. Not as funny as sold to me, but excellent.

***Working: Researching, Interviewing, Writing***, **Robert Caro**. How the greatest biographies are produced. The word "I" doesnn't appear out of quotes in ***The Power Broker*** -- Caro put all the "I"s here.

***The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks agains the United States***, **Jeffrey G. Lewis**. A speculative novel; I learned a lot. I didn't know the range of the Hwasong-15, and now I do. 

***Uncommon Carriers***, **John McPhee**. Immersive journalism; McPhee embeds with various freight transport systems; intimate portraits. The chapter on barges was excellent. 

***The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer***, **Siddhartha Mukherjee**. A history of cancer from ancient times to modern treatment. Unfocused at times. 

***The Piazza Tales***, **Herman Melville**. A collection of the short stories. I got it to re-read Bartleby, but every story was excellent

***Harry, A History: The True Story of a Boy Wizard, His Fans, and Life inside the Harry Potter Phenomenon***, **Melissa Anelli**. A document on the rise of fandom culture and online communities, by an insider and publisher.

***The Trials of Lila Dalton***, **L.J. Shepherd**. A novel; not worth my time, but I kept hoping it would get better.

***Batrachomyomachia, or, the Battles Between the Frogs and the Mice***, **trans. Alicia Stallings**. A beautiful and whimsical new translation of a Homeric parody. Grant Silverstein's illustrations make me want a physical copy. 

***The Collapse of Complex Societies***, **Joseph A. Tainter**. An argument that complex societies collapse when increasing complexity has negative marginal returns. Short and important, but not necessarily correct. Society has never been as complex as it is today.

***Don't Sleep, There are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle***, **Daniel L. Everett**. An anthropologist's popular account of his (and his family's) time with an isolated Amazonian tribe. Great anecdotes; I talked about this one a lot.

***The Lies of Locke Lamora***, **Scott Lynch**. Fantasy; I wasn't motivated to pick up book 2. 

***Nuclear War: A Scenario***, **Annie Jacobsen**. Similar to the ***2020 Commission Report*** above; much more speculative. 

***Debt of Honor***, **Tom Clancy**. Sometimes you just need a Jack Ryan novel. Who is the 1990s era Tom Clancy of today? 

***Executive Orders***, **Tom Clancy**. Ditto.

***El Diego***, **Diego Maradona (transcribed by Daniel Arucci)**. A memoir of the greatest footballer of the 20th century. Profane and extremely detailed. I talked about this one a lot. 

***Xinjiang in the Twenty-First Century: Islam, Ethnicity, and Resistance***, **Michael Dillon**. An examination of the status quo: ethnicity, religion, resistance.

***Pivot of Asia: Sinkiang and the inner Asian frontiers of China and Russia***, **Owen Lattimore**. From 1950; everything was already brewing. 

***Waiting to be Arrested at Night***, **Tahir Hamut Izgil**. A memoir of life under surveillance and oppression, and escape, as a poet. Very recent. 

***High: A Journey Across the Himalays, Through Pakistan, India, Bhutan, Nepal, and China***, **Erika Fatland**. A travelogue. 

⟳***What's Wrong with the World***, **G.K. Chesterton**. A critique of modern (1920s) social reforms; arguments that progressive solutions often worsen the problems they aim to fix. 

***A Matter of Honor***, **Jeffrey Archer**. A thriller, poorly dated.

***Kolymsky Heights***, **Lionel Davidson**. A Cold War thriller. The hero is an Alaskan native American. Parts get really weird. Overall good.

★***The Man Who Rode the Thunder***, **William Rankin**. A memoir of a fighter pilot who ejected in 1959 over a massive thunderstorm. It took him over an hour to hit to ground. He was struck by lightning while falling. It's really good!

***The General***, **C.S. Forester**. A novel of WWI, pathetic and devastating with an appropriately stiff upper lip. 

***Scoop***, **Waugh**. A satire of foreign journalists during African decolonization.

***The Inheritors***, **William Golding**. A novel imagining life through the eyes of a Neanderthal family as they encounter and are displaced by us. Meditations of consciousness, language, and violence.

★***True Grit***, **Charles Portis**. A western novel, truly funny and emotional.

***In a Free State***, **V.S. Naipaul**. A collection of novellas and stories; the one that sticks in my memory is about two Brits driving through a newly independent African country about to erupt in civil war.

***The Pursuit of the Millennium: Revolutionary Millenarioans and Mystical Anarchists of the Middle Ages***, **Norman Cohn**. A history of medieval apocalyptic movements, with lessons on how social upheaval sparked reovlutionary groups. 

***Wife to Mr. Milton***, **Robert Graves**. A novel about John Milton's tumltuous first marriage through the eyes of his wife. Good, but I don't know enough about the English Civil War to have really loved it. 

***The Nasty Bits***, **Anthony Bourdain**. A collection of his long essays, journals, and meditations. I love the travel stuff, but his true passion was always New York's restaurant scene.

***A Midwife's Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard, Based on Her Diary, 1785-1812***, **Laurel Ulrich**. A *very* deep biography of someone we otherwise would never have heard of: a midwife in post-revolutionary Maine. 

***Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb***, **Richard Rhodes**. More political and less physical than his more famous ***The Making of the Atomic Bomb***. I actually preferred this one. 

***Dominion: The Power of Man, The Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy***, **Matthew Scully**. A G.W. Bush speechwriter makes the case for you, a red-blooded American, to go vegan. 

***Nine Lives: My Time as MI6's Top Spy Inside al-Qaeda***, **Aimen Dean**. A memoir of an al-Qaeda defector, a specialist in bomb-making. The most interesting parts are early in his life, when he fought in Bosnia and the Philippines. 

***Churchill***, **Andrew Roberts**. A biography; does what it says on the tin.

***My Family and Other Animals: A True Story***, **Gerald Durrell**. A very funny account of a British childhood on Corfu in the 1930s, lots of wildlife and ribbing of his more famous brother Lawrence.

***The Story of My Life***, **Helen Keller**. A memoir, with a very long digression into a court case she was involved in at the time. 

***Consent: A Memoir***, **Vanessa Springora**. A memoir about a marriage, beginning in her teens and lasting half a century.

★***Beauties***, **Anton Chekov**. A collection of his stories, really excellent.

***The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia***, **A.N. Lankov**. A dry but fascinating modern account, from a Russian who has spent lots of time there. 

***William Blake***, **G.K. Chesterton**. A biography: Blake as a mystic. We think that he was a madman. If you think he was mad, well, he was just the last holdout of the spiritualists against the tide of rationalism.

***Raw Thought Raw Nerve: Inside the Mind of Aaron Swartz***, **Aaron Swartz**. A collection of his blog posts from a short, chaotic, driven life. Wikipedia and Reddit. 

★***Chronicle of a Death Foretold***, **Gabriel Garcia Marquez**. A journalistic novel. I've loved his non-fiction, and I'm easing into the big fiction.

***Fine Structure***, **Sam Hughes**. A sci-fi novel, very innovative and fun. Hughes (qntm) is an underrated and versatile plotmaster. 

***Readings***, **Michael Dirda**. A collection of columns by the Washington Post's books columnist. All of these are from before I could read, so they were all new. But I'm sure Dirda was in the water. 

***Very Important People***, **Ashley Mears**. An ethnography of VIP nightlife culture, using her experiences as a model-turned-academic.

★***The Fall of Constantinople***, **Steven Runciman**. A reconstruction of the 1453 Ottoman conquest of Constantinople. 

***Samson Agonistes***, **John Milton**. The famous poem. Truly great.

***Understanding Power***, **Noam Chomsky**. A thousand pages of transcripts of Chomsky in conversation. 

***Perspectives on the Security of Singapore***, **Ed. Barry Desker and Cheng Guan Ang**. A collection of essays; didn't quite scratch the itch but informative.

***The Midnight Library***, **Matt Haig**. I did not like this novel.

***Trick Mirror***, **Jia Tolentino**. A collection of essays on life and culture, growing up in the late 90s and 2000s.

⟳***The Cyberiad***, **Stanislaw Lem**. A collection of sci-fi stories from one of the all-time greats. 

***The Shooting Party***, **Isabel Colegate**. A classic depiction (and light satire) of English country life on the eve of WWI. 

★***Shuttle Down***, **G. Harry Stine**. The space shuttle lands on Easter island. This is not a good book. I loved it.

***Civilizations***, **Laurent Binet**. An alternate history: the Inca and Aztec invade Europe. I had really high hopes based on ***HHhH*** and this premise. Competent but not blown away. 

***Sperm Whales***, **Hal Whitehead**. Synthesizes decades of research on sperm whale biology, social behavior, and intelligence. 

***A Problem from Hell***, **Samantha Power**. Power the journalist meditates on the past century of genocide, and America's role. There's a mini-200 page biography of Raphael Lemkin in the early chapters, which shines.

***Imperial Reckoning***, **Caroline Elkins**. A new history of the Mau Mau uprising, and the vicious British response. 

***Jony Ive***, **Leander Kahney**. A biography of Apple's great designer. Probably a bit too early to be Great. Ive is mostly working of OpenAI at the moment.

★***Pnin***, **Vladimir Nabokov**. A campus novel. Possibly the best book I read this year.

***Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen***, **H. Beam Piper**. A sci-fi/alternative history from the 60s. Entertaining, ends abruptly

***The Vegetarian***, **Han Kang**. A South Korean novel about a woman who stops eating meat. 

***Our Lady of the Nile***, **Melanie Mauthner**. A book about a catholic girl's school at the source of the Nile in Rwanda, pre-genocide. Excellent! 

***Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?***, **Mark Fisher**. An argument; capitalist ideology is so pervasive that we can't imagine alternatives, and *this* is what is causing depressive resignation that paralyzes political and cultural imagination.

***The Grid***, **Gretchen Anna Bakke**. A modern history of America's aging electrical grid, especially focused on how problems of centralized design struggle with renewable engergy integration. 

★***Seven Seconds to Die: A Military Analysis of the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War and the Future of Warfighting***, **John F. Antal**. An analysis of the 2020 war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, with a focus on how drones, sensors, precision weapons, and AI are changing things. Will certainly be important.

***Ra***, **Sam Hughes**. Really weird and innovative modern sci-fi. Hughes has a top notch imagination.

***A Voyage Around the Queen***, **Craig Brown**. A posthumous biography of Queen Elizabeth II. Compelling.

***The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area***, **Malcolm Margolin**. A history of pre-colonial life in the Bay Area, detailing their ecological integration and knowledge. 

***To the End of June: The Intimate Life of American Foster Care***, **Cris Beam**. A portrait of foster parents and kids. A system which refuses to work. 

***Orbital***, **Samantha Harvey**. A novel; 24 uneventful hours on the ISS. 

***Sir Gawain and the Green Knight***, **Trans. J.R.R. Tolkien**. Tolkien translates the Middle English poem beautifully if not faithfully. Rollicking.

***The End of the World***, **Geoffrey Dennis**. A chronicle of apocalyptic predictiosn throughout history, examing religious prophecies, scientific scenarios, and cultural fears. From the 1920s, lots of rhymes.

***Offshore: Stealth Wealth and the New Colonialism***, **Brooke Harrington**. An academic goes undercover as a wealth manager. Not as informative as I hoped.

***Gray Matters: A Biography of Brain Surgery***, **Theodore H. Schwartz**. A brain surgeon writes about history and practice. The history chapters were weak, but he is a good writer and full of anecdotes.

***Making the Corps***, **Thomas Ricks**. A journalist embeds with a Marine Corps recruit platoon through boot camp, 9/11, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Perceptive about civil-military relations, but out of date. 

***The German Generals Talk***, **Basil Henry Liddell Hart**. A British historian interrogates Nazi generals and writes up the war from their perspective. Very insightful.  

***On the Run: Fugitive Life in an American City***, **Alice Goffman**. An ethnography of criminalized young black men in Philadelphia. Goffman got in trouble for getting too close to her subjects; the criticism was racial and sexual and flawed and just overall annoying.

***China's War with Japan: 1937-1945***, **Rana Mitter**. A history of that front; the American title was ***America's Forgotten Ally*** or something like that. Important to understand contemporary dynamics!

***Massacre in Malaya: Exposing Britain's My Lai***, **Christopher Hale**. Really an excellent history of Malaya (and Singapore!) from the 17th century; Hale uses the Batang Kali massacre as an excuse to trace the history of the region.

***Reentry: SpaceX, Elon Musk, and the Reusable Rockets that Launched a Second Space Age***, **Eric Berger**. The second book in Berger's SpaceX series, focusing on the Falcon 9 up through Falcon Heavy development. 

***Men at Arms***, **Evelyn Waugh**. The first in Waugh's WWII trilogy. Funny and insightful and I'm probably missing most of it by not being British.

***Officers and Gentlemen***, **Evelyn Waugh**. Second in the trilogy.

***Unconditional Surrender***, **Evelyn Waugh**. The conclusion; scathing of Americans. 

***The Eastern Front: A History of the First World War***, **Nick Lloyd**. Lloyd is writing a trilogy on WWI, the first was on the western front, and now he's moved on to the eastern. Very detailed military history. 

***Career and Family***, **Claudia Goldin**. How women's career opportunities (in America) evolved over generations. A master work of pop economics and rigorous history.

***True Porn Clerk Stories***, **Ali Davis**. A collection of essays about her experiences working at an adult video store in 2000s Chicago. Humorous and humanizing observations about customers, retail work, and society's relationship with pornography.

***19 Ways of Looking at Wang Wei***, **Eliot Weinberger**. A collection of 19 (almost 40 in the new edition) translations of a Tang dynasty poem, accompanied by often-scathing criticism from Weinberger

***Bea Wolf***, **Zach Weinersmith**. A reimagination of Beowulf in modern suburban America, beautifully illustrating, begging to be read aloud. 

***East African: An Airline Story***, **Peter J. Davis**. A history of East African Airlines, from the WWI days supporting the campaign in the Bundu to decolonization and bankruptcy. Excessively detailed.

Additionally, I re-read ⟳ all of the books in the ***1632*** series, the ***Murderbot*** series, and Wildbow's ***Worm***. But these are like candy and I'm midly ashamed. 

I also spent a lot of time with sub-books this year. Two of my favorite physical books are the Penguin collections of Borges fiction and non-fiction, and I found myself opening these and reading small selections often. The same with ***Tales from Shakespeare*** and Shakespeare plays; Raymond Carver, Tolstoy, Orwell's fiction and non-fiction, Ambedkar, and Keynes' collections. 

Poetry followed a similar pattern: I have two Norton anthologies and ***The Oxford Book of American Poetry*** on my tablet (in total, 5,000 pages of poetry!), and I would often flick through, sometimes reading them outloud on Whatsapp audio messages to people. I also revisited individual poets through the year: Byron, Rita Dove, Tennyson, Neruda, Tagore, William Blake, and Dickinson. But I've stopped trying to read books of poetry all at once.
