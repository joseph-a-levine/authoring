## Reading


> Thoreau would catch a bee and carry it to a place with a clear view of the landscape. There he would release it. He watched closely as the bee flew off. Then, once he lost track of it, he walked to the spot where it disappeared, and waited for a new bee to catch. Repeated enough times, this process would bring him to the nest.

> This is how I think about finding new books to read, and new people to hang out with (or, increasingly—new aspects of people I already know).

rm hartwell the industrial revolution and economic growth
“One economist, Wilhelm Roscher229 ( 1 8 17-94) , even maintained, perhaps rather rashly, that the potato was the cause of the population growth in Europe. We may be a little more cautious and grant that it may have been one of the causes” (Braudel, 1992, p. 167)

image generation does drive us crazy. but no more crazy than the last thing which removed a great sense of wonder. losing wonder is a systemic skill issue.

OK sanity check me here because I’m sure the devil is in the details, but if you’re investing in the stock market over the long, long haul, wouldn’t it statistically makes sense to invest on margin? 

The cost of borrowing is so much lower than expected market return.

There was an interesting academic paper which suggested this is particularly true for young savers for retirement. Their particular suggestion for mechanism was selling puts, IIRC, with intention to go into margin debt when assigned in event of market crashes.

Found paper. (Google did much better than I expected.) I did not successfully recall their option strategy.

[[American Revolution]] 
> Two hundred and fifty years ago, in April 1775, Boston was on edge. Seven thousand residents of the town shared these streets with more than 13,000 British soldiers and their families. The two groups coexisted uneasily.

I often say I'd be a tory...
> While the town had more of the people who called themselves Patriots than other colonies did—maybe 30 to 40 percent—at least 15% of the people in town were still fiercely loyal to the King and his government. Those who were neither Patriots nor Loyalists just kept their heads down, hoping the growing political crisis would go away and leave them unscathed.

But of course that's not true. I'd be one of the "heads-down" guys. Even though, wow, the british were on the right side of everything:
> Almost as soon as the French and Indian War was over, to prevent colonists from stirring up another expensive struggle with Indigenous Americans, King George III prohibited the colonists from crossing the Appalachian Mountains. 

Really beautiful!
> What Newman and Pulling did was simply to honor their friendships and their principles and to do the next right thing, even if it risked their lives, even if no one ever knew. And that is all anyone can do as we work to preserve the concept of human self-determination. In that heroic struggle, most of us will be lost to history, but we will, nonetheless, move the story forward, even if just a little bit.
