## Reading


> Thoreau would catch a bee and carry it to a place with a clear view of the landscape. There he would release it. He watched closely as the bee flew off. Then, once he lost track of it, he walked to the spot where it disappeared, and waited for a new bee to catch. Repeated enough times, this process would bring him to the nest.

### The Novelist Laureate of Peru

The Peruvian Nobel Prize winner died earlier this month. Vargas Llosa was probably the most famous living Peruvian, for his cutting novels, essays on liberalism, and [punching out Gabriel Garcia Márquez](https://jablevine.com/older/april_2025). Besides his non-fiction, I best remember "Tune in Tomorrow," "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter", and the short stories.

I was staying with MWG when Vargas Llosa died, at her apartment on Scott Circle in DC. The Peruvian embassy was across the street, and we stopped by in the evening with flowers and a note. There aren't many writers I would go so far out of my way for, but Vargas Llosa was so representative of Peru, it felt appropriate. Whom else would I do this for? Certainly Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o or Haruki Murakami. Probably Coetzee; maybe Isabel Allende and Margaret Atwood. 

A national voice, a novelist lareate, isn't guaranteed. Vargas Llosa didn't speak for all Peruvians, nor does Atwood for Canadias, and so on. There is no clear American now (and that's a fault of the novelists, not America); before, we have had Mark Twain and Hemingway and Steinbeck. No today is as successful at producing widely popular stories which become shorthand for how we see ourselves. 

### Braudel

Volume I of Fernand Braudel's "Civilization & Capitalism, 15th-18th Century" is one of the greatest lists of facts I've come across. It's 500 pages of minutiae; a whole chapter on grains, another on clothing, another on transportation. You'll notice the title is time-bounded; it is not geographically bounded. 

Braudel was of the _Annales_ school of history; a cabal of French historians focused on long-term social change. While the book is much stronger on Europe, and especially France, he makes an effort to include trivialities about Sichuan as well as Picardy. The chapter on grains spends more time on maize and rice than wheat; the chapter on transportation introduced me to "[sailed wheelbarrows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelbarrow#Chinese_sailing_carriage)."

His love of research is clear. If he is at times too credible (Japanese people do not call sitting in chairs "hanging up the legs"), it is balanced by healthy skepticism. Braudel writes: 

> “One economist, Wilhelm Roscher (1817-94) , even maintained, perhaps rather rashly, that the potato was the cause of the population growth in Europe.”{% sidenote "pocs-id" "This is cited to R.M. Hartwell's _The Industrial Revolution and Economic Growth_, which I do not have access to." %}

I understand why Braudel calls this rash! And yet -- Nathan Nunn and Nancy Qian, fifty years after Braudel, [found](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/nunn/files/nunn_qian_qje_2011.pdf) that the potato was responsible for _one-quarter_ of European population growth!{% sidenote "notesq-id" "Notably, Nunn and Qian don't cite Roscher!" %} I love Braudel all the more for being wrong. 

This is just Volume I. Volumes II and III of "Civilization & Capitalism" focus more on the high economy than everyday life. I may read the second, on the development of international commerce, but I'm likely to stay away from the last. Here, Braudel takes on Marxist materialism. I don't need 500 pages of that. 

The other big history book of the month was Barbara Tuchman's "A Distant Mirror," a history of the French 14th century, and more specifically a biography of Enguerrand VII de Coucy. Tuchman is an amazing writer, and while much more narrative than Braudel, there were fun facts aplenty. After I finished, MWG put on "A Knight's Tale" (the Heath Ledger movie), which has many of the same characters.{% sidenote "quee-id" "And a few _Queen_ songs." %}

> Two hundred and fifty years ago, in April 1775, Boston was on edge. Seven thousand residents of the town shared these streets with more than 13,000 British soldiers and their families. The two groups coexisted uneasily.

I often say I'd have been a Tory...
> While the town had more of the people who called themselves Patriots than other colonies did—maybe 30 to 40 percent—at least 15% of the people in town were still fiercely loyal to the King and his government. Those who were neither Patriots nor Loyalists just kept their heads down, hoping the growing political crisis would go away and leave them unscathed.

But of course that's not true. I'd be one of the "heads-down" guys. Even though, wow, the British were on the right side of everything:
> Almost as soon as the French and Indian War was over, to prevent colonists from stirring up another expensive struggle with Indigenous Americans, King George III prohibited the colonists from crossing the Appalachian Mountains.
