## Updates 

I started August in Bonn, on my way to Geneva, and I'm ending the month back in Oxford. Though the school year is still six weeks away, it feels like the home stretch of summer. Besides a trip to The Gambia next month, I'm likely to be in Oxford until the Christmas break. This is 

I was happy to be back in Switzerland. Geneva is less interesting than Bern or any of the small towns I've stayed in, but makes up for it with the wonderful variety of license plates. I was there as a mentor for the [CHERI](https://www.xrisk.ch/) fellas, an accomplished and eclectic group of students working on existential risk projects. A supermajority of them were focused on AI, for which I abdicated any mentoring responsibility, but I learned a lot. 

My Wonderful Girlfriend (hereafter MWG){% sidenote "mwg-id" "She first proposed WC for a proper anonym, after Martha Gelhorn's use of Unwilling Companion for her less-well-known [traveling partner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway) in her delightful collection *[Travels With Myself and Another](https://jablevine.com/older/june_2021)*. We mutually rejected it due to latrinic connotations and it making her sound like a sidekick." %} left for China at the end of August, where she'll be for the next year. 



## Reading

### Ethnomathematics
  
A [few months ago](https://jablevine.com/older/june_2023), I wrote a bit about Netz's *A New History of Greek Mathematics*, in particular his translations of fundamental Greek mathematical concepts.{% sidenote "grenu-id" "For example, the Greeks' broadest conception of the word 'number' referred to positive integers excluding 1 — which was not a number, but the unit by which other numbers are measured." %} This book spun me into a slight enthnomathematical reading spell, which has developed into a middling addiction. 

Both the ethnographic (interesting anthropological studies of human interactions with mathematics) and the mathematical (how these interactions are interpreted and decoded mathematically) sides are interesting. This distinction is fine: many human actions can be explained mathematically — by you and me — without the actors having the same knowledge. Paulus Gerdes gives the example of four-fold basket weaving in his wonderful teaching book *Geometry from Africa*:{% sidenote "basym-id" "For the designs, see section 2.2, 'From Decorative Designs With Fourfold Symmetry to Pythagoras', available on LibGen or from [me](https://jablevine.com/hi/)." %} these designs implicitly reflect the earliest proofs of Pythagoras's theorem. The weaver follows an inherited artistic and utilitarian tradition, not mathematical calculation. We know what we're looking for: a larger square of four identical triangles, enclosing a smaller square — the rest of the proof is something I saw in eighth grade. Their practical art bears mathematical reasoning embedded within. 

While the geometry is fun (and it's what captures Netz's and Gerdes' curiosity), the original point of curiosity among ethnomathematicians is certainly number theory. This is partly because the first ethnomathematics was conducted by linguists.{% sidenote "sapwh-id" "I will not, I will not, I will not discuss Sapir-Whorf directly." %} A culture's number words and base reveal foundational mathematical concepts. That is, if they have number words as we understand them. The Pirahã, an indigenous people in Brazil are an extremely well-studied example{% sidenote "frak-id" "This section taken from Frank et al.'s *[Number as a cognitive technology](doi:10.1016/j.cognition.2008.04.007)*." %} due to their lack of numbers. Explicitly, they "have no linguistic method whatsoever for expressing exact quantity, not even 'one'." 

Despite extreme exceptions such as the Pirahã, numbers are almost universal. But even then there is great variety. 

My favorite example is the Yupno of Papua New Guinea.{% sidenote "sorpis-id" "Sources here are [Wassman and Dasen 1994](https://doi.org/10.1177/0022022194251005) and Wassman 1991." %} My fascination with them is inherently a bit speculative. First, they were only studied ethnographically decades after the national government began providing language{% sidenote "tokp" "Tok Pisin." %} and mathematical schooling to the region. Only the oldest members of the are familiar with their counting system; children "usually know only the vernacular words for 1, 2, and 3; they usually count in Tok Pisin even when they use the vernacular." Second, the authors had only limited access to the Yupno community. My claim about the Yupno — which the authors imply, but do not state — is that their men count in base 33 and women count in base 30. 

The Yupno use a body-tally number system. This is similar to how most base-10 systems, what we're used to, came about: you start at one finger, and move to the next until you get to ten. But the Yupno observe that there are more body parts than just fingers. Wassman provides this diagram:

{% maincolumn "assets/img/yupno.png" "" %}

The problem, I think, is obvious.

However, we don't have any *direct* evidence for the claim of gendered base systems. According to the authors, their "sample does not include any women because tradition does not allow them to count in public; attempts to question some of them in spite of this failed because the situation was too strange for them." Further, it was rare for the Yupno to deal with numbers larger than 30, and therefore the practical different is mostly irrelevant.{% sidenote "obs-id" "Base only becomes relevant mathematically once the base is exceeded. In a base-11 system, our 11 and their 11 are the same, but our 12 is equivalent to their eleventy-one or whatever. Of course, you can call eleventy-one 'twelve' but then you're in a baseless linguistic system and being purposefully obtuse so stop it." %} The primary example is the payment of bride prices, which is also notable for being the only occasion when men and women count together. Wassman again:

> Occasions to go beyond two or three men{% sidenote "bodmen-id" "When the Yupno men reached 33, they would pick another man present and count using his bodyparts." %} would have been rare; traditionally, higher numbers were only used in the exchange of bride price, and even then it would have been unusual to count more than 33 pigs.

That's the outline of how the Yupno ended up with a gendered base system. 

### The Shadow of the Sun

My favorite book from this month was *The Shadow of the Sun* by Ryszard Kapuściński. Almost no one travelled as widely in Africa as Kapuściński, a (*the*) Polish journalist covering the third world from the ~1960s to the ~1990s.{% sidenote "widesm-id" "This is quite a claim but I challenge anyone" %} 




From the start, I tried to counterattack: „You were colonized? We, Poles, were
also! For one hundred and thirty years we were the colony of three foreign powers. White ones, too.” They
laughed, tapped their foreheads, walked away. I angered them, because they thought I wanted to deceive
them. I knew that despite my inner certainty about my own innocence, to them I was guilty.

Almost diametric to a story i heard xx tell (ezra klein)
so are jews more african than poles?


## Music

The new Zakir Hussein, Edgar Meyer, and Béla Fleck album is self-recommending, and I really loved it. Other fantastic new listens from the past week: 

- Big L — Lifestylez Ov Da Poor & Dangerous
- Qasim Naqvi – Two Centuries
- New Carly Rae Jepsen album
- Lain Huuto — Valoon!
- Almach — Don’t Look Back


## Sport

As Oxford undergrads disappear in the summer, the Thames changes. Fours replace eights, coaches become increasingly desperate for work, and boats spin willy-nilly, up or downstream of the designated areas. After Kazakhstan, and my first ever session in a scull, the Brasenose coach Tim suggested I sign up to row at Henley opens — just two weeks later. This was a terrible idea and I immediately agreed. 

Eight sculling sessions in the next eleven days abosolutely *skinned* my hands, but also got me to the point of a non-embarrassing racing start. I was prepared to lose with open water, but had almost reached the point of confidence where I wouldn't go for a swim in the Henley Reach. Unfortunately, both Tim and I were struck by an administrative delay which forbade our participation. While he called it "gutting", and I empathized (perhaps too much...), I can't say I'm *too* disappointed my sculling debut has been postponed.


Oxford University baseball also has it's 2023-2024 schedule!

- @ Essex MT1
- @ Surrey MT3
- vs Kent MT4
- vs KCL HT4
- @ Imperial HT6

With three games in October, I'm excited to see how an understaffed Rangers get along. We'll definitely have sell-out crowds, so book your travel and seats early.
