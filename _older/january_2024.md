## Updates 

Happy New Year! 2023 was much less busy than 2022, but still packed. 

Also — I've added a links section below.

## Reading

Here is [the list of books I've read this year](https://jablevine.com/older/2023_books), and here's [last year's list](https://jablevine.com/older/2022_books). Last year, I read 30 books in translation; this year, it was six, and three of those were by Kapuściński. My ratio skewed more towards non-fiction this year, with a few  interesting intermediate (**HHhH**, **Behind the Beautiful Forevers**, **Incest Diary**, all of Kapuściński).

This list is shorter than last year's, for two reasons. First, I had less time.

Second, there was a prolific debate this year about reading, kicked off by Sam Bankman-Fried's [comments](https://archive.ph/Yg64e#selection-1695.320-1707.251) in an interview with Sequoia Capital. “I would never read a book," SBF tells the interviewer.

> I’m not sure what to say. I’ve read a book a week for my entire adult life and have written three of my own.
> 
> “I’m very skeptical of books. I don’t want to say no book is ever worth reading, but I actually do believe something pretty close to that,” explains SBF. “I think, if you wrote a book, you fucked up, and it should have been a six-paragraph blog post.”

Everyone else has had an attempt at psychoanalyzing Sam over the past year; I'll have my go on this quote. Our culture attributes great status to people who write books; book authors get a lot of respect from other high-status people, in a way that bloggers, tweeters, long-form journalists don't. But a book is a 5-10 hour imposition on someone's time, and by reading a book, you're putting yourself and your attention into the author's hands for that time. SBF saw his own time as too valuable for anything like that.{% sidenote "blvg-id" "Cf. videogames on Bloomberg." %} He was an extreme: I've met CEOs and heads of state — people much busier than SBF was — who read much more widely than I do. It often comes from a place of humility.{% sidenote "pribo-id" "I don't know how prison works — if he has access to six-paragraph blog posts— and this is not meant as a gotcha but I am curious to know if he is reading books now." %}

Richard Hanania riffed on SBF — his [contribution](https://www.richardhanania.com/p/the-case-against-most-books) to the debate — "The Case Against (Most) Books" — attacks popular non-fiction{% sidenote "hoel-id" "Eric Hoel, whose second non-fiction books is coming out this year, has another good [article](https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/p/why-do-most-popular-science-books) in this genre." %} and the classics. 

I'm actually not going to defend against these attacks; that's The Atlantic's [job](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/kanye-west-sam-bankman-fried-books-reading/672823/). I'll even agree that popular non-fiction can stay on the shelf forever. But I think my reading habit is closer to a TikTok addiction than a sign of high conscientiousness, intelligence, or any other [high status thing](https://arjunpanickssery.substack.com/i/135613869/reading-books-is-incredibly-high-status). Reading books is my default activity, the first thing I do when I have *nothing* else to do; my sister goes on a run; my girlfriend downloads more law journal articles; my mom gardens; one friend in my PhD does gig data science tasks.{% sidenote "sadatsc-id" "He gets paid, a pittance, but says it's mostly a way to 'relax.'" %}

The very first book I [reviewed](https://jablevine.com/older/may_2021#books) on this blog was *How to talk about books you haven’t read*, by Pierre Bayard. Bayard 



### Should I care about the intelligence of the animals I eat

> The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? 
> 
Jeremy Bentham, *Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation*

Not separate from suffering, but above it — is it worse to torture, kill, and eat an intelligent than unintelligent animal? Many of my friends are v*gan; have worked at organizations promoting [animal welfare](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/) or started [websites](https://www.animalwelfarelibrary.org/). I eat meat. I also read a lot about non-human animals and how our society interacts with them. This isn't about that, but rather about animals most of us don't — currently — eat.{% sidenote "doeat-id" "Of course, we do eat intelligent animals. Pigs  solve mazes, pass mirror tests, vocalize, engage in complex play. " %}

Any list of the smartest animal would include great apes, elephants, some parrots, octopuses, maybe dolphins. This month, I read books about baboons, octopuses, and elephants.{% sidenote "banb-id" "The book about baboons — which are not great apes — was an accident, I read about octopuses largely for this purpose, and the essay and two books about elephants were prompted by MWG." %} I don't plan to change my eating habits because of these books — I wouldn't have eaten any of these species before, and still won't — but I did prod my intuition about how factors into my moral patience.

Humans do eat **primates**. It's now well-agreed that AIDS originated from bush meat, almost certainly from a chimpanzee, hunted and consumed in the Congo, soon before 1921.{% sidenote "orig-id" "Jacques Pépin's *The Origins of AIDS* is the scientific and legible history. I read it in 2020 and have returned to certain chapters for various reasons. The final chapter, *Assembling the puzzle*, tells the full story clearly. " %} But it is becoming rarer, which I attribute to unavoidable  and logical anthropomorphization. 

Humans do eat **elephants**. The elephant Orwell [shot](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/shooting-an-elephant/) was eaten: "Burmans were bringing dash and baskets even before I left, and I was told they had stripped his body almost to the bones by the afternoon." Eating elephants has never been common,{% sidenote "djjljdel-id" "Except for geologically brief eras during the human migration out of Africa, with various Proboscidea." %} and is becoming rarer, due to effective conservation among dwindling populations. 

My elephant spree started with Caitrin Keiper's massive "[Do Elephants Have Souls?](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/do-elephants-have-souls)" in The New Atlantis. Many of the epigraphs scattered throughout were drawn from Lyall Watson's *Elephantoms*. Watson was a South African zoologist; an excellent writer, but wholly too credible.{% sidenote "whbel-id" "The most fantastic moment in his book, which Keiper ended her essay with, was when 'the last remaining Knysna elephant' apparently has a conversation with a blue whale. I'm willing to accept nature is weird and animals are capable of much more than we imagine but the circumstances are much weirder than my short summary suggests and seriously come on dude." %} He is a great enough writer to make the book worth our time. 

Humans do eat **octopuses**. They are the worst off. It has always been difficult to catch and preserve octopuses, but technology is [making life easier for us and harder for them](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64814781).
