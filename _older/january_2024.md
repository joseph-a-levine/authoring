## Updates 

Happy New Year! 2023 was much less busy than 2022, but still packed. 

Also — I've added a links section below. These are various interesting or fun things I've found on the internet this month.

## Links

{% newthought "The ( somewhat apocryphal) story of Alexander von Humboldt's" %} [parrot](https://www.strangehistory.net/2010/11/02/the-parrots-of-the-atures/). As normally told, while on the Orinoco River{% sidenote "ene" "Somewhere in modern-day Venezuela." %} in the early 19th century, the German naturalist encountered parrots kept by one tribe, which had captured them from another tribe they had recently massacred. These parrots were the only reservoir of the Maypure language. This version of the legend was made famous by Darwin, but the truth is a bit more complicated. 

Anders Sandberg factchecked: 

> The names do not match Humboldt’s journals, and the story seems to appear some 60 years after the expedition. The Maipure language is indeed extinct, but was a lingua franca language along the upper Orinoco rather than local. However, Humboldt does mention a story relating to the Ature tribe{% sidenote "a-id" "Sandberg isn't quite right here — that Ature didn't go extinct, but became known by other names, the Piaroa or Adole. The language also survived in human speakers, under these names." %} that went extinct in the mid1700s and that an old parrot that might have spoken their language was shown in Maypures — but it is unclear if he actually saw it and there is no evidence he recorded any words.

{% newthought "A long, funny [story](https://ofgeography.tumblr.com/post/735900283288387584/so-at-the-time-i-was-traveling-a-lot-for-work) about BTS in the" %} airport in Santiago, Chile.

{% newthought "[Edmond-Charles Genêt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond-Charles_Gen%C3%AAt) was Louis XI's" %} ambassador to Russia when the French Revolution hit, was personally evicted from St. Petersburg by Catherin the Great{% sidenote "ctgr-id" "'not only superfluous but even intolerable'" %} in 1792, and was then immediately appointed French ambassador to the US by the Girondins.{% sidenote "t-dd" "In high school, I was fascinated by Tallyerand's ability to surf the tides of French politics. Now, I'm convinced that the foreign policy institutions were more robust to revolution." %} He took a ship directly to Charleston, South Carolina, where he hung out for two years recruiting American privateers against the British (including one ship named after himself, the *Citzen Genêt*). This pissed off Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson, who, working together, got the French government to recall Genêt. 

By that point, the [Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain) had come to power and would have guillotined Genêt if he came back. Hamilton got him asylum. He married the daughter of the governor of New York, and lived the rest of his life outside Albany.

{% newthought "While in the US for the holidays, I was thinking of" %} going down to Fort Bragg to visit some friends, but I learned that it was recently renamed to Fort Liberty, because Mr. Bragg was a Confederate general. Of, course, "Republican candidates Ron DeSantis and Mike Pence in the 2024 presidential election have both pledged to rename the base back to Fort Bragg if elected president." I think Democrats could add this to their platform as well, based on Bragg's Service to the Union:

[[USAID]] hired [[NASA]]'s previous head of contracts. [write up](https://unlockaid.substack.com/p/welcoming-a-new-hire-from-nasa). optimistic stuff. could bring in strong py for perfomrnce stuff


https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/22/22-30686-CV0.pdf

I know you just finished exams and probably don't want to do law stuff but can you explain what happened here? my understanding is Landor can't get any damages because the warden and officers were acting in "individual capacities" which doesn't fit my understanding of the phrase (they were on the clock? in uniform?). 

Bigger question, is there, then, no protection here? if he can't get damages, etc, is he just unprotected by religion stuff? can corrections officers knock kippahs off, pull off dastars, etc, even if a court rules that they are religiously exempt

Smller question: don't you think these judges were pissed that the officers threw their literal jdugement in the literal trash?

According to sam, this was jsut a judgemnt under RLUIPA, not [1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan_Act). He'll probably do alrightunder 1983

>Acting preemptively, Landor explained that he was a practicing Rastafarian and provided proof of past religious accommodations. And, amazingly, Landor also handed the guard a copy of our decision in Ware v. Louisiana Department of Corrections, 866 F.3d 263 (5th Cir. 2017), which held that Louisiana’s policy of cutting the hair of Rastafarians violated RLUIPA. Unmoved by our caselaw, the guard threw Landor’s papers in the trash and summoned RLCC’s warden, Marcus Myers. When Myers arrived, he demanded Landor hand over documentation from his sentencing judge that corroborated his religious beliefs. When Landor couldn’t instantly meet that demand, two guards carried him into another room, handcuffed him to a chair, held him down, and shaved his head.

>We *emphatically* condemn the treatment that Landor endured. Still, we remain bound by our prior decision in Sossamon I that, under RLUIPA, he cannot seek money damages from officials in their individual capacities. In re Bonvillian, 19 F.4th at 792 (the rule of orderliness). Because the district court correctly held so, we AFFIRM.


{% newthought "Zhan Xianzhong" %}
Also read about [[Zhang Xianzhong]]. He was a 17th century Chinese general, rebel and [[genocide]]. Led a peasant rebellion. Killed *everyone* in [[Sichuan]]. 

> The last Ming census figure for Sichuan in 1578 (more than 60 years before Zhang entered Sichuan) gave a population of 3,102,073. However, by 1661 (55), only 16,096 adult males were registered in Sichuan, and Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers.

## Reading

Here is [the list of books I've read this year](https://jablevine.com/older/2023_books), and here's [last year's list](https://jablevine.com/older/2022_books). Last year, I read 30 books in translation; this year, it was six, and three of those were by Kapuściński. My ratio skewed more towards non-fiction this year, with a few  interesting intermediate (**HHhH**, **Behind the Beautiful Forevers**, **Incest Diary**, all of Kapuściński).

This list is shorter than last year's, for two reasons. First, I had less time. 

Second, there was a prolific debate this year about why we read, what counts as reading, and how to read well. An often-cited concept in my circle is Holden Karnofsky's "[Reading books vs. engaging with them](https://www.cold-takes.com/reading-books-vs-engaging-with-them/)." Karnofsky claims what we call "reading" is inefficient and inaccurate,{% sidenote "tab-id" "The first table in that link." %} and advocates for a more roundabout path to gleaning knowledge from books.{% sidenote "abl" "The second table." %} His (implied) preferred efficient method of getting knowledge from/of a book "in areas one isn't an expert in" is: 

> Read reviews/discussions of the book; locate the parts of the book they’re referencing, and read those parts carefully, independently checking footnotes, and referring back to other parts of the book for any unfamiliar terms. Write down who I think is being more fair; lay out the exact quotes that give the best evidence that my judgment is right. (But never read the whole book)	

This is defensible — and [other people](https://arjunpanickssery.substack.com/i/135613869/most-people-remember-roughly-nothing-that-they-read){% sidenote "scsta-id" "Tho I think [Tanner Greer](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-education-of-american-strategist.html) is a better citation for the claim at that link than Karnofsky." %} have found it useful. My main problem is that this strategy is often not possible. Finding reviews and (importantly) author replies for most books is very difficult! Here are three books ([one](https://www.amazon.com/-/he/Suzanne-Levi-Sanchez/dp/0815356218), [two](https://www.amazon.com/Legislative-Development-Africa-Politics-Postcolonial/dp/110849210X), [three](https://www.amazon.com/Active-Defense-Military-Princeton-International/dp/0691152136)) which I would like to understand deeply, and I'm willing to put Karnofsky's suggested 16 hours into each. But there is not a rigorous debate on these these books; I could find a single academic reviews of two, but no author replies. Often, a book is the last word on itself.

This year's reading discourse was kicked off by Sam Bankman-Fried's [comments](https://archive.ph/Yg64e#selection-1695.320-1707.251) in an interview with Sequoia Capital. “I would never read a book," SBF tells the interviewer.

> I’m not sure what to say. I’ve read a book a week for my entire adult life and have written three of my own.
> 
> “I’m very skeptical of books. I don’t want to say no book is ever worth reading, but I actually do believe something pretty close to that,” explains SBF. “I think, if you wrote a book, you fucked up, and it should have been a six-paragraph blog post.”

Everyone else has had an attempt at psychoanalyzing Sam over the past year; I'll have my go on this quote. Our culture attributes great status to people who write books; book authors get a lot of respect from other high-status people, in a way that bloggers, tweeters, long-form journalists don't. But a book is a 5-10 hour imposition on someone's time, and by reading a book, you're putting yourself and your attention into the author's hands for that time. SBF saw his own time as too valuable for anything like that.{% sidenote "blvg-id" "Cf. videogames on Bloomberg." %} He was an extreme: I've met CEOs and heads of state — people much busier than SBF was — who read much more widely than I do. It often comes from a place of humility.{% sidenote "pribo-id" "I don't know how prison works — if he has access to six-paragraph blog posts— and this is not meant as a gotcha but I am curious to know if he is reading books now." %}

Richard Hanania riffed on SBF — his [contribution](https://www.richardhanania.com/p/the-case-against-most-books) to the debate — "The Case Against (Most) Books" — attacks popular non-fiction{% sidenote "hoel-id" "Eric Hoel, whose second non-fiction books is coming out this year, has another good [article](https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/p/why-do-most-popular-science-books) in this genre." %} and the classics. 

I'm actually not going to defend against these attacks; that's The Atlantic's [job](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/kanye-west-sam-bankman-fried-books-reading/672823/). I'll even agree that popular non-fiction can stay on the shelf forever. But I think my reading habit is closer to a TikTok addiction than a sign of high conscientiousness, intelligence, or any other [high status thing](https://arjunpanickssery.substack.com/i/135613869/reading-books-is-incredibly-high-status). Reading books is my default activity, the first thing I do when I have *nothing* else to do; my sister goes on a run; my girlfriend downloads more law journal articles; my mom gardens; one friend in my PhD does gig data science tasks.{% sidenote "sadatsc-id" "He gets paid, a pittance, but says it's mostly a way to 'relax.'" %} I don't think my reading habit is defensible because it [funges](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/28/thank-you-for-doing-something-ambiguously-between-smoking-and-not-smoking/) against other things I'd like to be doing.{% sidenote "funge-id" "Including, sometimes, the things other people do without trying, like exercising, gardening, or [writing](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/)." %}

There is one way I am *extremely* annoying about books: gifts. If you've gotten me a book as a gift,{% sidenote "bsw-id" "This only applies to non-*Star Wars* books, but as I haven't gotten one of those as a gift since 2012, it applies to all books I've received as a gift since 2012." %} I have almost certainly not read it. There is one well-publicized exception, which is my [Amazon wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3AR981U16OKZ0?ref_=wl_share). If you buy me a book off this list, it is close to certain I will read it. 

The very first book I [reviewed](https://jablevine.com/older/may_2021#books) on this blog was *How to talk about books you haven’t read*, by Pierre Bayard. Bayard 

### Should I care about the intelligence of the animals I eat

> The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? 
> 
Jeremy Bentham, *Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation*

Not separate from suffering, but above it — is it worse to torture, kill, and eat an intelligent than unintelligent animal? Many of my friends are v*gan; have worked at organizations promoting [animal welfare](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/) or started [websites](https://www.animalwelfarelibrary.org/). I eat meat. I also read a lot about non-human animals and how our society interacts with them. This isn't about that, but rather about animals most of us don't — currently — eat.{% sidenote "doeat-id" "Of course, we do eat intelligent animals. Pigs  solve mazes, pass mirror tests, vocalize, engage in complex play. " %}

Any list of the smartest animal would include great apes, elephants, some parrots, octopuses, maybe dolphins. This month, I read books about baboons, octopuses, and elephants.{% sidenote "banb-id" "The book about baboons — which are not great apes — was an accident, I read about octopuses largely for this purpose, and the essay and two books about elephants were prompted by MWG." %} I don't plan to change my eating habits because of these books — I wouldn't have eaten any of these species before, and still won't — but I did prod my intuition about how factors into my moral patience.

Humans do eat **primates**. It's now well-agreed that AIDS originated from bush meat, almost certainly from a chimpanzee, hunted and consumed in the Congo, soon before 1921.{% sidenote "orig-id" "Jacques Pépin's *The Origins of AIDS* is the scientific and legible history. I read it in 2020 and have returned to certain chapters for various reasons. The final chapter, *Assembling the puzzle*, tells the full story clearly. " %} But it is becoming rarer, which I attribute to unavoidable  and logical anthropomorphization. 

Humans do eat **elephants**. The elephant Orwell [shot](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/shooting-an-elephant/) was eaten: "Burmans were bringing dash and baskets even before I left, and I was told they had stripped his body almost to the bones by the afternoon." Eating elephants has never been common,{% sidenote "djjljdel-id" "Except for geologically brief eras during the human migration out of Africa, with various Proboscidea." %} and is becoming rarer, due to effective conservation among dwindling populations. 

My elephant spree started with Caitrin Keiper's massive "[Do Elephants Have Souls?](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/do-elephants-have-souls)" in The New Atlantis. Many of the epigraphs scattered throughout were drawn from Lyall Watson's *Elephantoms*. Watson was a South African zoologist; an excellent writer, but wholly too credible.{% sidenote "whbel-id" "The most fantastic moment in his book, which Keiper ended her essay with, was when 'the last remaining Knysna elephant' apparently has a conversation with a blue whale. I'm willing to accept nature is weird and animals are capable of much more than we imagine but the circumstances are much weirder than my short summary suggests and seriously come on dude." %} He is a great enough writer to make the book worth our time. 

Humans do eat **octopuses**. They are the worst off. It has always been difficult to catch and preserve octopuses, but technology is [making life easier for us and harder for them](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64814781).
