## Updates

Man, I looved the olympics. highlight might ahve been mountain biking, but the athletics were also great. I know myself, and the two road races were tons of fun to watch. Breakdancing was intresting; the men were much more fun to watch than the women. I'm not opposed to it being in the olympics, but we should probably add a lot a lot more if that's going to clear the bar. 



Another August spectacle: 
Take me to church, drugs

10 minutes applause. Started in Phoenix 
Sydney, and O say can you see orioles whatever 
Canonically, capricious. Has to be talked into broken hearts 
Secret song was “i did something bad” which like Uber trickster goddess

Went to [[Taylor Swift]] at wembley last night. With [[Abigail]] [[Olivia]] [[Charlotte Waldman]].

The feeling was sur-real. She is a post-modern trickster goddess. Opening with Lady Gaga's song "I live for the applause," then two songs emphasizing her power (making the whole crowd cheer when she points, transitioning to "the man"). What we see on the screen is a facade (I felt like I was one of the few people really trying to watch *her* despite the crowd. She doesn't show up on your phone well, so the phones were pointed at the jumbotron). Big fake expressions to show better on the jumbotron, long pauses. There's a mind working under the facade, but it's an alien one. It delights in the attention (I life for the applause), and gives back attention. 

In [[Phoenix]], Olivia tells me they started to do a long applause after champagne promises, which has gotten longer ever since. The song isn't even that great or impessive

The spell broke when she brought up Covid. Lost some timelessness.

[[Nathan Goldwag]] has a nice review of a children's series, the dark is rising:

a slight work of passion. leaves off at the end of the cold war and the arrival of Khan Noonian Singh. Eugenics war, short peace, long WWIII (china invades india, front in africa, front in south america, etc. etc.). Big nukes end it. civil wars. First contact with the vulcans. Slow consolidation and rebuilding. 

>However, in the most famous incident, a Vulcan atmospheric shuttle en route from Shanghai to Mumbai in 2094 went down in a Himalayan valley uncontacted since the end of the war. The Indian military scrambled Search & Rescue teams, but when their helicopters finally tracked down the crash site, they discovered the Vulcan engineer eight hours into a debate with the local Buddhist priest over the nature of consciousness. History does not record who won.

Eminently plausible, except for the vulcan bit. we're lucky genes are hard. we're lucky for peace. Really lucky — almost all of the 80 year period covered is warfare. 

> The Crisis of the 21st Century lasted ninety-one years, and resulted in the deaths of approximately 2.4 billion people, 30% of the human population of the time. In much of the world, life expectancy did not return to the level it had been in 1990 until the 2150s, and even with Vulcan aid, the ecological damage continues to be felt to this day. The global order collapsed more than once, and by the time it was over, large portions of the planet had reverted to barbarism and anarchy

bubble; mentioned this article to olivia and she immediately recited twenty facts about ballerinafarm



[[Mormons]] believe Eve was wise and right to eat the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. [[Paradise Lost]]

> By making Juilliard part of the Ballerina Farm story, the life she’s living now is framed as the one she chose over the life she could have had as a professional ballerina. SHE TOOK A BITE OF THE FORBIDDEN (BIG) APPLE BUT THEN DECIDED TO GO BACK INTO THE GARDEN. Can you hear me yelling, “ARE YOU SEEING THIS?!”



I started reading an article about the ballerinafarm influencer who olivia is obbsessed with. then followed anne helen petersen down her archives. and got to this one:
https://the-toast.net/2013/07/04/things-of-which-i-may-not-speak/
She's a really good writier. i wish her books (about millenial angst and working from home etc) didn't sound so boring.



a great [[Admiral Cloudberg]] about an Air Maroc flight which *bounced twice on the ocean and then no one said anything.* Thanks to [[Ozy Brennan]] for linking it. The captain just like, got awa ywith it.



Uncovered by admiral cloudberg "The only survivor of the crash stated to the investigators that a crocodile smuggled in a duffel bag by one of the passengers had escaped shortly before landing, sparking panic among the passengers. The flight attendant rushed towards the cockpit, followed by all passengers, and the resulting shift in the aircraft's centre of gravity led to an irrecoverable loss of control.[2] The crocodile reportedly survived the crash, only to be killed with a machete by authorities.[12]"

"The 1980 census reported only 206,000 Indian immigrants in the US." The parents of [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], [[Kamala Harris]], and Usha Vance were among these (also Bobby Jindal). "How did the children of Indian immigrants reach the top of US establishments in just one generation?" We should read more about the experience of [[India]]n Americans. 
https://srajagopalan.substack.com/p/kamala-harris-usha-vance-and-the
Including re-visiting Jhumpa Lahiri
1) "Most Indians in the US come from upper or dominant castes."
2) "They were selected through highly competitive exams in India to enter top educational institutions or by the American schools where they studied."
3) "US immigration policies favored skilled professionals, creating a filter for the best candidates, further refined by the competitive American job market with the H1B visa lottery since the mid-nineties."

> Usha’s last name is typically associated with the Telugu Kamma caste. But she and her family are vegetarians and, as one friend said, “sound” like Telugu Brahmins.

this is about sharks not whales. but she does mention the whale shark a few times. Katherine Rundell is the world’s greatest writer about fauna.

In WWI, the US government sent a cheque as a payment for airplane manufacturing to Ettore Buggati so fast that he took it to his local bank to ask if it was valid because he'd never received payment from a government so promptly before.
