## Updates

August was a good month. My sisters visited, bribed by tickets to Taylor Swift at Wembley, and 

The first week of August was Olympic obsessed. My overall highlight was the mountain and road cycling, but the final days of track and field were classical Olympic fun, especially narrated by my sister's commentary. Breakdancing was interesting; I'm glad it was included, but not sad to see it go.{% sidenote "rayc-id" "I watched all six hours of the women's competition, and don't remember the Australian at all. The memes went over my head." %} Flag football will replace it at the 2028 LA games, which I expect I'll watch with the same amount of enthusiasm. 

### Eras Tour

Mid-August brought another spectacle: my sisters visited, bribed by tickets to Taylor Swift at Wembley. This was their third time at the Eras tour, and I got a guided tour. 

Everything that can be written about Taylor Swift has been written. My experience was sur-real. She is a post-modern trickster goddess. Opening with a Lady Gaga's song ("I live for the applause"), and early on making er power explicit by making the whole crowd cheer when she points, transitioning to *The Man*. What we see on the screen is a facade.{% sidenote "stac-id" "I have never been to a stadium show before, and didn't feel in sync with the crowd. I was trying to watch *her*, but at these distances, she doesn't show up well on your phone camera, so most attention was directed to the jumbotrons. Also a privilege of height." %}  Stadium-sized expressions to show better on the jumbotron, long pauses. There's a character working under the facade, but it's an alien one. The character delights in the attention ("I live for the applause"), and gives back attention. 

The height of this comes after *Champagne Problems*, somewhere just past the halfway mark. My sister Olivia told me that, at the first shows in Arizona, the crowd had cheered for seven minutes. That was 18 months ago, and crowds since have competed for who can hold the ovation longer. The camera stays tight on Taylor Swift the entire time. At Wembley, she only basked in the noise for about four minutes before cutting the crowd off. 

The performance of capricious fae nature is, like everything else, orchestrated. She performs a silent skit with two dancers before launching into *I Can Do It With a Broken Heart*. The dancers attempt to coerce a listless Taylor Swift into dressing in a sparkly two-piece and heels, and physically shove her towards the audience. This is all so she can sing "I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day" in C major.{% sidenote "luck-id" "Which, honestly, was like going to a Britney Spears concert and hearing *Lucky.* How am I supposed to feel after this? Do you *want* me to cheer? " %}

A friend here in Oxford, JW, called *The Eras Tour* the largest cultural wave of our generation. On those subjective criteria, I can't think of many competitors.{% sidenote "com-id" "The MCU, or the rise of K-pop, maybe. Game of Thrones and Hamilton might have competed, but didn't have staying power." %} I know several people in their 60s and 70s who devour academic and critical books about *The Beatles* and other bands of their youth. I left Wembely wondering if I'll be so interested in Taylor Swift in my time.

a slight work of passion. leaves off at the end of the cold war and the arrival of Khan Noonian Singh. Eugenics war, short peace, long WWIII (china invades india, front in africa, front in south america, etc. etc.). Big nukes end it. civil wars. First contact with the vulcans. Slow consolidation and rebuilding. 

>However, in the most famous incident, a Vulcan atmospheric shuttle en route from Shanghai to Mumbai in 2094 went down in a Himalayan valley uncontacted since the end of the war. The Indian military scrambled Search & Rescue teams, but when their helicopters finally tracked down the crash site, they discovered the Vulcan engineer eight hours into a debate with the local Buddhist priest over the nature of consciousness. History does not record who won.

Eminently plausible, except for the vulcan bit. we're lucky genes are hard. we're lucky for peace. Really lucky — almost all of the 80 year period covered is warfare. 

> The Crisis of the 21st Century lasted ninety-one years, and resulted in the deaths of approximately 2.4 billion people, 30% of the human population of the time. In much of the world, life expectancy did not return to the level it had been in 1990 until the 2150s, and even with Vulcan aid, the ecological damage continues to be felt to this day. The global order collapsed more than once, and by the time it was over, large portions of the planet had reverted to barbarism and anarchy

[[Mormons]] believe Eve was wise and right to eat the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. [[Paradise Lost]]

> By making Juilliard part of the Ballerina Farm story, the life she’s living now is framed as the one she chose over the life she could have had as a professional ballerina. SHE TOOK A BITE OF THE FORBIDDEN (BIG) APPLE BUT THEN DECIDED TO GO BACK INTO THE GARDEN. Can you hear me yelling, “ARE YOU SEEING THIS?!”



I started reading an article about the ballerinafarm influencer who olivia is obbsessed with. then followed anne helen petersen down her archives. and got to this one:

She's a really good writier. i wish her books (about millenial angst and working from home etc) didn't sound so boring.



a great [[Admiral Cloudberg]] about an Air Maroc flight which *bounced twice on the ocean and then no one said anything.* Thanks to [[Ozy Brennan]] for linking it. The captain just like, got awa ywith it.



Uncovered by admiral cloudberg "The only survivor of the crash stated to the investigators that a crocodile smuggled in a duffel bag by one of the passengers had escaped shortly before landing, sparking panic among the passengers. The flight attendant rushed towards the cockpit, followed by all passengers, and the resulting shift in the aircraft's centre of gravity led to an irrecoverable loss of control.[2] The crocodile reportedly survived the crash, only to be killed with a machete by authorities.[12]"

"The 1980 census reported only 206,000 Indian immigrants in the US." The parents of [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], [[Kamala Harris]], and Usha Vance were among these (also Bobby Jindal). "How did the children of Indian immigrants reach the top of US establishments in just one generation?" We should read more about the experience of [[India]]n Americans.

Including re-visiting Jhumpa Lahiri
1) "Most Indians in the US come from upper or dominant castes."
2) "They were selected through highly competitive exams in India to enter top educational institutions or by the American schools where they studied."
3) "US immigration policies favored skilled professionals, creating a filter for the best candidates, further refined by the competitive American job market with the H1B visa lottery since the mid-nineties."

> Usha’s last name is typically associated with the Telugu Kamma caste. But she and her family are vegetarians and, as one friend said, “sound” like Telugu Brahmins.

this is about sharks not whales. but she does mention the whale shark a few times. Katherine Rundell is the world’s greatest writer about fauna.

In WWI, the US government sent a cheque as a payment for airplane manufacturing to Ettore Buggati so fast that he took it to his local bank to ask if it was valid because he'd never received payment from a government so promptly before.
