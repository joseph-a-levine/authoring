## Updates 

{% newthought "We're hiring! Me and my co-PIs" %} are hiring a [research coordinator](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/careers/research-coordinator-university-essex-job-104861) to run an RCT in The Gambia. 

I've had a job like this — I worked in Sierra Leone for for a year on RCTs run by European and American academics. I wasn't great at this job, but I learned dense and useful lessons about how development research is produced — lessons which have been useful as I've become more involved with designing and organizing such projects.

Of course, the implicit deal here is that, in addition to learning how development research works, you'll get letters of recommendation for doctoral programs. My reference (as a second year PhD student) is worthless, but my coauthors Victor and Justine h

### Admiral Cloudberg

[Admiral Cloudberg](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/){% sidenote "clups-id" "Nomen verum Kyra Dempsey" %} has published a blog post about a different plane crash every week for the past five years. I came across her work in the most recent [Asterisk](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/05/why-you-ve-never-been-in-a-plane-crash), and read more than a hundred of her articles in the last week of January.{% sidenote "long-id" "Roughly the length of the first four Harry Potter books together." %} 

Part of the fascination is the disaster porn — Cloudberg generously breaks up her 10,000 word essays with photos of wreckage every few paragraphs — but the [*competence* porn ](https://kfmonkey.blogspot.com/2009/08/leverage-204-fairy-godparents-job-post.html) is more compelling. The heroes here are the crash investigators, famously in NTSB-emblazoned windbreakers in the US, though Cloudberg plenty of overseas crashes too.{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "Five of her last ten posts have been about plane crashes in the US. But the NTSB is often invited to lead or assist investigations overseas. " %} 

Cloudberg's loyalty lies with the process: individual investigators are rarely named,{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "This is a random sidenote" %} and the question

Admiral Cloudberg

Like Matt Levine

a system which functions so well — much like finance — and fails softly most of the time, has a long tail.

There's also a lesson to be taken about portability of systems. Air travel is so safe because it's so complex. Everything is designed to work smoothly together 
TCAS in Switzerland, Russian and American pilots have different reactions to 

After reading fifty-odd articles about plane crashes, I began to worry that I could have given myself a fear of flying. As I come to the end of her archives, I think Cloudberg has had the opposite effect. Air disasters are arbitrary and horrific, but reading about the crashes illustrates how particular the causes are. So rarely are two crashes caused by the same thing — because we plug those gaps as quickly as we can{% sidenote "cavec-id" "The caveats to this are that it often takes a fatal accident to plug a gap, and the plug is rarely immediate. " %} — that as we more forward in time, the causes of crashes become even more particular.

Consider [SmartLynx Estonia flight 9001](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/the-dark-side-of-logic-the-near-crash-of-smartlynx-estonia-flight-9001-68b9f42b1fb2). This flight was doing something that a plane will never do while I'm aboard — dozens of touch-and-go landings for training new pilots on the A320.{% sidenote "a20-id" "The A320 was the first fly-by-wire airliner, a technology that was controversial among pilots, for restricting their piloting envelope, and among potential passengers for one of [the most cinematic crashes](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/fly-by-wire-the-crash-of-air-france-flight-296-55f8ec38375b) in history." %} The combination of a slightly-too-viscous lubricant on a set of microswitches with a very unusual flight profile (dozens of landings in a single flight) caused the computer systems controlling the flight surfaces to shut down. I say "systems" because "to lose control over the elevators, four computers must fail at the same time." And yet, this did happen. And yet, the A320 did not crash: the pilots still recovered.

> Four flight control computers failed consecutively, both engines quit, and electrical power was lost. And yet, even after so many things went wrong, there were still more backup systems. The A320 was designed to be flyable using only the mechanical backups [...] in the event of the complete failure of all its computers.

In the aftermath, the government and investigators, Airbus, and the airline made changes to make sure that *this* particular failure could never happen again. Training procedures were updated, maintenance logging changed, and manuals were edited. It's humbling — we optimize, backup, and reinforce systems, but disaster sneaks through. The pilots deal with it the best they can, and the investigators make sure it never happens again.

The US did a great job eradicating malaria. But some of these problems were [self-inflicted](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24550628)
> However, the TVA developed their anti-mal programs because they created lakes suitable for mosquito breeding. [...] I find that the net effect of the TVA was to increase malaria rates following its construction. Using statistical life value estimates, 1 find that the hidden malaria cost of the TVA offset 24 percent of the fiscal stimulus multiplier generated by the TVA.
