## Updates 

{% newthought "We're hiring! Me and my co-PIs" %} are hiring a [research coordinator](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/careers/research-coordinator-university-essex-job-104861) to run an RCT in The Gambia. 

I've had a job like this — I worked in Sierra Leone for for a year on RCTs run by European and American academics. I wasn't great at this job, but I learned dense and useful lessons about how development research is produced — lessons which have been useful as I've become more involved with designing and organizing such projects.

Of course, the implicit deal here is that, in addition to learning how development research works, you'll get letters of recommendation for doctoral programs. My reference (as a second year PhD student) is worthless, but my coauthors Victor and Justine h

### Admiral Cloudberg

[Admiral Cloudberg](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/){% sidenote "clups-id" "Nomen verum Kyra Dempsey" %} has published a blog post about a different plane crash every week for the past five years. I came across her work in the most recent [Asterisk](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/05/why-you-ve-never-been-in-a-plane-crash), and read more than a hundred of her articles in the last week of January.{% sidenote "long-id" "Roughly the length of the first four Harry Potter books together. It was not a productive week." %} 

Part of the fascination is the disaster porn — Cloudberg generously breaks up her 10,000 word essays with photos of wreckage every few paragraphs — but the [*competence* porn ](https://kfmonkey.blogspot.com/2009/08/leverage-204-fairy-godparents-job-post.html) is more compelling. The heroes are the crash investigators, most often and famously in "NTSB"-emblazoned windbreakers, though Cloudberg covers plenty of overseas crashes too.{% sidenote "fivhal-id" "Five of her last ten posts have been about plane crashes in the US. But the NTSB is often invited to lead or assist investigations overseas, and makes surprising cameos on every continent. " %} 

Cloudberg's loyalty is to the process: individual investigators are rarely named,{% sidenote "chip-id" "The only investigator I recall being named more than once is the Kiwi Ron Chippindale, and that's [an ignominious honor](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/an-orchestrated-litany-of-lies-the-crash-of-air-new-zealand-flight-901-7259e6afba83)." %} and the her posts spend many more words detailing the investigation, technical causes of the accident,{% sidenote "deic-id" "I know now *so much* about de-icing processes." %} and recommendations to prevent future incidents than the disaster itself. 

Her writing reminds me of no one so much as Matt Levine. I don't care about [the crash of two seaplanes in Alaska](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/warnings-unheard-warnings-unheeded-the-story-of-the-2019-alaska-mid-air-collision-89a3444fe7d7) any more or less than I care about LATEST MONEY STUFF COLUMN. But both try to make clear vital, complex, and often opaque systems which people trust implicitly. High finance and air travel both function perfectly to four nines, and fail softly to another two nines, but the insights come from looking at the tail where the system breaks down. 

The most interesting lesson I learned from Cloudberg was about the portability of complex systems. Air travel is so safe because it's so complex. It's also international — planes cross borders, so the system most work as well in Russia as it does in Antarctica as it does in Texas as it does over the Indian Ocean. 

Take collision avoidance. From the dawn of American airliners to to the 1970s, American passenger planes collided mid-air on average once every 18 months. Today, collisions still happen, but they have become much rarer.{% sidenote "arv" "But the ones that do happen are the result of 'a marvel of engineering — beginning hundreds of kilometers apart, two aircraft, both on autopilot, were able to adhere so closely to an imaginary airway at such a precise barometric altitude that they plowed directly into one another, like two speeding bullets meeting in midair. Forty or fifty years ago, such a collision would have been highly improbable, simply because lateral and vertical navigation equipment lacked the required accuracy. Perhaps 99 times out of 100, the two planes would have sailed past each other at 100 or 200 meters’ distance, unaware of the other’s presence.' From a [different in-air collision](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/the-fickle-hand-of-fate-the-amazon-mid-air-collision-and-the-crash-of-gol-transportes-a%C3%A9reos-ab407547b1b2), the most recent between passenger jets." %} First, computers plot routes more precisely, placing airliners at different altitudes and paths before they ever take off. Then, the same computers and modern radar can warn controllers if any planes may come close to each other. And then, as an ultimate backup if controllers fail, modern jets have traffic collision avoidance systems (TCAS, pronounced tee-cas), which warns pilots of impending collisions, by directing the two planes away from each other. 

This system works very well when everyone follows the rules. But in the [2002 Überlingen mid-air collision](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/tears-in-the-rain-the-2002-%C3%BCberlingen-midair-collision-591232d0c51e), the same system imported to different cultures *caused* a disaster. A jet chartered from a Russian airline was accidentally placed on a collision course with a DHL cargo plane running behind schedule, and the relevant controller didn't notice it until late, due to ATC system maintenance. By the time the controller noticed, and ordered the Russian jet to descend, TCAS had also noticed the imminent collision, ordering the Russian plane to *ascend*. 

> As it was conceived in America, TCAS is a last line of defense, a surefire way to prevent a collision if the principles of air traffic control and “see and avoid” should prove inadequate. As such, there is no circumstance under which a TCAS resolution advisory should be disregarded, as its very activation implies that other means of collision avoidance have already failed.

But in Russia, "controllers wielded a level of absolute authority that they never held in the West," and the pilots, hearing contradictory instructions, chose to follow the human controller and descend — directly into the DHL plane, which TCAS had ordered to do as well. The system would have worked in either cultural milieu — but where they crossed, the backup to the backup failed, and tragedy was finally inevitable. 

And sometimes these systems are imported to places where they cannot operate at all. The two dumbest, most insane crashes Cloudberg wrote about both happened in Africa: the overloaded [UTAGE flight 141](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/a-wish-and-a-prayer-the-crash-of-utage-flight-141-a73d38206871) failing to get off the runway in Cotonou, and [RwandAir flight 205](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/collision-with-the-terminal-the-crash-of-rwandair-flight-205-ea6dc5beabfa) crashing into the terminal (on the ground) for no good reason. I don't have much to say about these, except that the first was a tragedy I cannot imagine occurring anywhere except West Africa, and the second was an epic brain fart. But culture is evident on airplanes. I've never seen a more orderly disembarkation than landing in CDMX, nor a more chaotic one than Kabul. 

After reading fifty-odd articles about plane crashes, I began to worry that I could give myself a fear of flying. As I come to the end of her archives, I think Cloudberg has had the opposite effect. Air disasters are arbitrary and horrific, but reading about them illustrates how particular the causes are. So rarely are two crashes caused by the same thing — because we plug those gaps as quickly as we can{% sidenote "cavec-id" "The caveats to this are that it often takes a fatal accident to plug a gap, and the plug is rarely immediate. " %} — that as we move forward in time, the causes of crashes become even more particular.

Consider [SmartLynx Estonia flight 9001](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/the-dark-side-of-logic-the-near-crash-of-smartlynx-estonia-flight-9001-68b9f42b1fb2). This flight was doing something that a plane will never do while I'm aboard — dozens of touch-and-go landings for training new pilots on the A320.{% sidenote "a20-id" "The A320 was the first fly-by-wire airliner, a technology that was controversial among pilots, for restricting their piloting envelope, and among potential passengers for one of [the most cinematic crashes](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/fly-by-wire-the-crash-of-air-france-flight-296-55f8ec38375b) in history." %} The combination of a slightly-too-viscous lubricant on a set of microswitches with a very unusual flight profile (dozens of landings in a single flight) caused the computer systems controlling the flight surfaces to shut down. I say "computer system*s*" because "to lose control over the elevators, four computers must fail at the same time." And yet, this did happen. And yet, the A320 did not crash: the pilots recovered manual control.

> Four flight control computers failed consecutively, both engines quit, and electrical power was lost. And yet, even after so many things went wrong, there were still more backup systems. The A320 was designed to be flyable using only the mechanical backups [...] in the event of the complete failure of all its computers.

In the aftermath, the government investigators, Airbus, and the airline made changes to make sure that *this* particular failure could never happen again. Training procedures were updated, maintenance logging changed, and manuals were edited. It's humbling — we optimize, backup, and reinforce systems, but disaster sneaks through. The pilots deal with it the best they can, and the investigators make sure it never happens again.

{% newthought "The US eradicated malaria" %} by 1950, and much credit goes to New Deal agencies, including the TVA. But the TVA may also have made malaria worse. Using my favorite instrumental variable *ever*,{% sidenote "dams-id" "The Duflo and Pande dam approach, also one of my favorite [one-word paper titles](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2022-08/Dams.pdf)." %} [Carl Kitchens found that ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24550628) the TVAs dams and resevoirs actually *increased* malaria mortality and morbidity. 
> I find that the net effect of the TVA was to increase malaria rates following its construction [of dams]. Using statistical life value estimates, I find that the hidden malaria cost of the TVA offset 24 percent of the fiscal stimulus multiplier generated by the TVA.

{% newthought "Why had no one told me" %} about the c.100 CE parody of the Iliad about a war between mice and frogs, watched by the gods? The [Batrachomyomachia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batrachomyomachia), literally "Battle of the Frogs and Mice." Full text [here](https://sacred-texts.com/cla/homer/frogmice.htm), a 15 minute read. 

{% newthought "[Huge progress](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/us-government-wants-make-world-lead-free-why-thats-big-deal-and-how-we-can-make-it-happen?utm_medium=cgd_email) on reducing lead" %} poisoning in Africa. I remember talking about the chances of the US government making this a priority a couple years ago with folks at [LEEP](https://leadelimination.org/) and OPP, and no one was optimistic. Big win from Administrator Power. 

{% newthought "I want to find out more" %} about [this BBC announcer](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n02/rosemary-hill/talking-about-manure) from the early 1930s but "david tennant bbc" is ungoogleable.

{% newthought "This was a nice essay" %}, on [Orwell and India](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-failed-saint-on-george-orwells-india/). The author mentions "a wildly entertaining 1984 essay called *In Search of a Jaarj Arwil*;" can anyone find this for me? I've looked high and low; $20 bounty.
