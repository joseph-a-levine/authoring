## Reading <a name="books"></a>

The first "serious" history book I read was McCullough's "[1776](https://smile.amazon.com/1776-David-McCullough/dp/0743226712)," which I found under a friend's bed during a middle school sleepover. Since then, it's always surprised me when history carries over from December 31st of one year to January 1st of the next. To a sixth grader, memorizing dates and places, the year is the natural unit of historical analysis. 

A year is also convenient. It's *convenient* that in 1968 the Tet Offensive kicked off in January and the first men arrived at the moon on Christmas Eve. 2020 had a Joycean story arc. 

Ray Huang's "[1587, a Year of No Significance](https://smile.amazon.com/1587-Year-No-Significance-Dynasty/dp/0300028849)" has an irresistible title. Huang presents a snapshot of the declining Ming Dynasty in an entirely inconsequential year. The year has no convenient plot elements; no coups, no new emperor, no plague or invasion.

> Really, nothing of great significance happened in 1587, the Year of the Pig. China was not facing a foreign invasion, nor was the country engulfed in a civil war. Even though the capital district did not have sufficient rain during the summer and epidemics broke out in those months, and though drought was reported in Shantung, and flood in South Chihli, and earth- quakes took place in Shansi in the autumn, none of these disasters occurred in alarming proportions. For an empire as immense as ours, such minor incidents and setbacks can only be expected. On the whole, the Year of the Pig would go down in history as an indifferent one.

> Can we therefore omit that year from history books? Not quite.
