## Notes on Gambia

One fun fact my friends have probably gotten tired of by now: The Gambia is [one of two countries](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411013024/https://www.africanews.com/2017/01/19/why-africa-s-smiling-coast-is-referred-to-as-the-gambia/) with the definite article "the" in it's official name, the other being The Bahamas.  This supposedly comes from the first Gambian president's worry of being confused with Zambia. 

I can report feeling stupid whenever I call it The Gambia to a The Gambian. "I missed The Gambia," I told my friend who met me at the airport. "The Gambia always feels so welcoming." Gambians don't make it any easier. Gambians who have spent time in Europe and the US and Canada are careful to use the country's official name,{% sidenote "taiw-id" "Gambians who studied in Taiwan or China universally avoid the "The"." %}  but it's less common among taxi drivers, tax collectors, or school kids. You know, the salt-of-the-earth The Gambians.{% sidenote "mandi-id" "English is the second language of Gambians. I asked native Wolof and Mandinka speakers how they referred to the country; most didn't notice or care, a few reported just ``Gambia.'' No one reliably used the ``The'' in their first language, even people who always included it in English." %}  They just live in Gambia. 

I was there for two weeks, and the middle weekend was Eid al-Adha, or Tabaski. This cost me and CL a work day, but we're lucky it didn't cost us two: the government was considering declaring both Monday and Tuesday festival days. The uncertainty isn't new. When I lived in [Sierra Leone](https://jablevine.com/older/july_2021), the president would often announce national holidays on the morning of the holiday. When I was out for a morning run, I could see drivers start to pull U-turns as the news spread. Gambia wasn't quite so last minute, but thankfully the festival only lasted one day.

Banerjee and Duflo's essay "The Economic Lives of the Poor"{% sidenote "loadb-id" "Loadbearing." %} has a memorable section on the importance of festivals and religious spending for people living under the extreme poverty line ($1.08 in consumption per day). Even at the expense of nutrition and health, festival spending remains high in many contexts.{% sidenote "shifent-id" "The main lever is other forms of entertainment: in India, where festival spending is high, radio and TV ownership is low, and v.v." %} Gambians conform: it felt like a different country during Tabaski. 

Part of this is the people: there is a large diaspora return for the festival. They bring gifts and spending money. 

I spent Tabaski with a friend's family



## Reading


First was "Shakespeare's Kings" by Norwich. It is an history of the period covered by Shakespeare's Henriad (the eight plays about Richard II, Henry IV, Richard III, and Henry V, plus the misattributed*Edward II*). I've read the Henriad twice through. The first was in 2021, entirely on the couch of my first house in Sierra Leone. The days were *hot* and I didn't like moving at all. I would lay on the couch in only my shorts, and mumble the great speeches and machinations. This read was inspired by a compelling tidbit I had found in the diary of an English colonial officer: the second *ever* performance of *Richard II* was staged in Freetown. The play has some plot elements which may be concerning to sitting monarchs, and after the Earl of Essex's failed uprising in 1601, London's director of revels had seen fit to ban the play. In 1607, the *HMS Dragon* had brought copied of several Shakespeare plays, including the newly printed *Hamlet* — and Freetown was far enough from London for even such controversial plays to go on. I hadn't — and still haven't — been able to find out where in the city the plays were staged, but perhaps I'll look further one day. The Royal Navy tends to keep good records.

The second book I started is "The Life of Martha Ballard". She was the midwife in a small town in Maine at the end of the 18th century; she delivered several babies a week. Less importantly, she kept a diary every day for almost thirty years. The book is written by an historian of early American women's labor, and she has much to teach using Ballard as the frame. Ballard is an interesting character, tho her diary is not immediately revealing — her most emotional outburst is, in its entirety: "Shocking." This comes after the judge accused of raping her friend is acquitted in court. 

If we don't learn much about her internal life from her diary, we can find stuff out from the epidemiology. In the first 300 births she directs, only one mother dies. This is the 1780s, remember. Today, in Sierra Leone, more than five women would have died in the same number of births. I'm only 150 page in; I intend to continue picking away.

Finally, I opened up Richard Rhodes' "Dark Sun". I'm sure you've heard plenty of AI boys talking with passion about his "The Making of the Atomic Bomb"; Dwarkesh (Kate's brother's boss' podcast) had Rhodes on to talk about the book without warning him that the podcast was actually about AI. It was pretty funny. I enjoyed TMotAB plenty (before I knew what AI was), but I don't think it's the right analogy to AI. "Dark Sun" is what the AI boys should be reading. 

Now, where I say "AI boys", who I mean is Leo. And here's the drawn out metaphor which I'm putting in his mouth: 
1. American AI companies are the US.
2. The current frontier is the Hiroshima bomb.
3. After viewing the efficacy of the current frontier, and the scientific principles underlying it (scaling, or "unhobbling" (Leo's invention)), China will freak out and demand frontier models of its own.
	1. Compare to: Little Boy and Fat Man scared the USSR; especially Fat Man, as the underlying Pb physics light the way to the hydrogen bomb.
4. "ASI" is the hydrogen bomb.

"The Making of the Atomic Bomb" ends once the atomic bomb is, you know, made. In "Dark Sun", Rhodes picks up where he had left off. Rhodes' physics are as strong as in TMotAB, but the physics are not the center of "Dark Sun".  The focus (at least, of the first 200 pages) is on the Soviet effort for the bomb, beginning in 1940.  And the Soviet effort was not led by the scientists but the spies.


This month also saw the 100th anniversary of Mallory and Irvine's death on Mount Everest. My wonderful girlfriend was at Everest base camp on the day, and I sent a short message to her group of friends: 

On 8 June, 1924, George Mallory and Sandy Irvine attempted to summit Mount Everest. They both died that night. Mallory was 38, and widely regarded as the best climber in Europe. Irvine was just 22, an undergraduate at Oxford, and had never climbed outside of England before his trip to Tibet. While Mallory's body was recovered, perfectly preserved, in 1999, Irvine has never been found.

The climb remains a mystery — some mountaineers believe that Mallory and Irvine reached the summit, and met calamity on the way down. The most suggestive evidence is a photograph, or the lack of one: Mallory had brought a picture of his wife to place on the summit, and the photograph was not found on his body. Unfortunately, it's more likely their ascent proved intractable — the route they planned to take was _possibly_ within Mallory's abilities, but would have stymied Irvine (the most difficult section is an ascent of 40m, at an altitude of 8.610m, rated a V+ or 5.9 free). 

Mallory and Irvine's attempt was the final assault on Everest after four years of English campaigns, and there was not another serious attempt on the mountain until the 1950s. The Dalai Lama had been offended by various English disrespects, and forbade further expeditions. Indeed, the first confirmed ascent, by Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hilary in 1954, was staged from the Nepali side. Not until 1960 did a team of Chinese climbers complete the route attempted by Mallory and Irvine.

A spectacularly fabulous opening to a book review: https://delong.typepad.com/egregious_moderation/2009/01/matt-taibbi-flathead-the-peculiar-genius-of-thomas-l-friedman.html
> I was told that Thomas Friedman had a new book coming out. All my editor knew about it was the title, but that was enough; he approached me with the chilled demeanor of a British spy who has just discovered that Hitler was secretly buying up the world's manganese supply. Who knew what it meant but one had to assume the worst.



The German ambassador in London at the outbreak of WWI was named Karl Marx. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Max,_Prince_Lichnowsky

OpenAI's library, regrettably, looks really cool: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/technology/openai-library-office.html


An unsourced claim on a blog: 

> If you get toddlers, or hunter-gatherers with no exposure to Western mathematics, to say what number is halfway between 1 and 9, they say 3, because the ratio 3:1 is the same as the ratio 9:3. In other words, our intuitive perceptions of numbers are actually logarithmic and not linear.

This is insane to me. I want to look for an academic source. Wow.

His girlfriend in that piece is Eve Bigaj, and while procrastinating ("the things I want to do are not the things I want to do") I read some of her blog. Here's an interesting one: "Sex in Senegal": https://evebigaj.medium.com/sex-in-senegal-cfd48ee260

She moved to Senegal with Ben when he was setting up a Wave pilot there. She was very innocent of the sexual atmosphere and status quo qua race in Senegal: that is, white women travel there to have sex with Senegalese men. She has bad experiences, leading to firing her house guard for asking to kiss her. But she takes the blame:

> I’m not trying to excuse him. No means no. But when someone moves into a brothel, almost everything they say will sound like “yes.” And moving into a brothel is basically what I’d done [by moving to Senegal].

Gambia is the same, but a bit worse. Not just for women: If I'm walking alone, someone will come and talk to me every 50 meters (the key is to answer, but never to stop walking). Cebbina had it worse. Being with another non-Gambian is the fastest way to be left alone; whenever I walk with a Indian or European friend here, no one talks to us. 



Orwell: 
> Among the German prisoners captured in France there are a certain number of Russians. Some time back two were captured who did not speak Russian or any other language that was known either to their captors or their fellow prisoners. They could, in fact, only converse with one another. A professor of Slavonic languages, brought down from Oxford, could make nothing of what they were saying. Then it happened that a sergeant who had served on the frontiers of India overheard them talking and recognized their language, which he was able to speak a little. It was Tibetan! After some questioning, he managed to get their story out of them.
> 
> Some years earlier they had strayed over the frontier into the Soviet Union and had been conscripted into a labour battalion, afterwards being sent to western Russia when the war with Germany broke out. They were taken prisoner by the Germans and sent to North Africa; later they were sent to France, then exchanged into a fighting unit when the Second Front opened, and taken prisoner by the British. All this time they had been able to speak to nobody but one another, and had no notion of what was happening or who was fighting whom.
> 
> It would round the story off neatly if they were now conscripted into the British army and sent to fight the Japanese, ending up somewhere in Central Asia, quite close to their native village, but still very much puzzled as to what it is all about.

view of the Iliad: https://reasonableapproximation.net/2024/06/18/book-review-the-iliad.html
Sometimes I try to do things with language. I don't write much poetry anymore, though I do sometimes still translate Bengali and Spanish poetry into English for fun. But the Iliad is special; translating it is weird because of the very prescribed and specific choices in language. What are iambs? Do people even notice nowadays? 
Why isn't the Iliad useful? The review has a discussion of marked choice: things happen, Homer meant them to happen, but what do they mean?? What do they tell us about the society? we don't ahve the context on ancient greece to know. And that's bad.
