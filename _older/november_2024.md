## Updates

This was the first month of the third year of my PhD. It's a polarizing year -- half of the economists I know say it was the best year of their PhD; the other half say it was the worst. At the beginning of the year, a student is expected to be broadly exploring many projects; by the end of the year, the student should have a Research Agenda and a self-definition and a table of contents for their dissertation and — well, it's a busy year. 

I spent October in Oxford only, exploring. Here's a non-comprehensive list of what I've been working on:

{% newthought "Public finance and the local social contract" %}  in Gambia — we're going to baseline next month for an RCT that will span 2025. This is my first big project from start-to-finish; there are parts of it I love, parts of it I abhor, and parts which confuse me. But I've learned a lot very fast. 

{% newthought "The political economy of policy advice" %}  — what do current models of expert policy advice leave out, especially in poor countries? Most of this advice is not coming from academics, even if it's based on our work. 

{% newthought "Using LLMs to extract estimates from papers" %} to make meta-analyses easier. Or at least easier for the research assistants who have had to do this manually for ages. I've had mild success so far, but everything still requires manual review. Maybe a 60% time-savings (which is great!).

{% newthought "Forecasting accuracy over different timeframes" %} — you might have heard me more pretentiously ask, "What is the shape of the forecasting error curve?" I've been dancing around this question since 2021; Eva Vivalt and Duncan Webb are digging back in.

{% newthought "A couple of AI research topics" %} in poor countries, which I'm hesitant to talk about publicly (because nothing has been thought through yet). 

{% newthought "Why are temporary energy" %}  solutions becoming permanent across Africa? I've talked many peoples' ears off about Karpowership, a Turkish company which operates 50+MW diesel power plants on container ships. There's been on anchored off Accra for a most of a decade, and another dozen spread around the continent. This is weird. 

{% newthought "The political economy of malaria" %}  eradication. An emerging dynamic: many poor countries National Malaria Eradication agencies, and also have national vaccine programs. The distribution of malaria vaccines in several Central African countries have been delayed by political infighting over who gets the funding, responsibility, and credit.

Other than work, October remains an S-tier month. Oxford looks fabulous in fog and orange hues. My wonderful girlfriend visited for my birthday; I am deeply grateful for United's Dulles-to-Heathrow flight. We've made three pumpkin pies in the last four days. 

Other highlights include: a demo of the Apple Vision Pro in London, Nabokov's *Pnin*, thrifting with LH, and a *very* affectionate kelpie moving in down the street.

{% newthought "An esoteric branch of math" %} called [fraction theory](https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2024/09/17/our-fractional-universe/) may hold the answers to science’s deepest mysteries"

{% newthought "George Orwell on the cost" %}  of [books](https://orwell.ru/library/articles/cigar/english/e_cigar). Of course, this was a poor country at a poor time.
> It is difficult to establish any relationship between the price of books and the value one gets out of them. “Books” includes novels, poetry, text books, works of reference, sociological treatises and much else, and length and price do not correspond to one another, especially if one habitually buys books second-hand. You may spend ten shillings on a poem of 500 lines, and you may spend sixpence on a dictionary which you consult at odd moments over a period of twenty years. There are books that one reads over and over again, books that become part of the furniture of one's mind and alter one's whole attitude to life, books that one dips into but never reads through, books that one reads at a single sitting and forgets a week later: and the cost, in terms of money, may be the same in each case.


{% newthought "Gwern on Matt Levine" %}; [self-recommending](https://gwern.net/matt-levine). It's a question I've asked before. Gwern's answer is elegant and fine: Levine covers a complicated subject with "news" every day which is actually news — there's a new angle or something to each story. His counterexample (barfights and court reporting) is unfair. 

{% newthought "The plaque on the" %} [Eastern Scheldt Barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oosterscheldekering) defending Netherlands from the North sea reads: "Here the tide is ruled by the moon, the wind, and us."

{% newthought "The US Marine Corps'" %} [Small Unit Leader's Guide to Mountain Warfare Operations](https://www.marines.mil/Portals/1/MCRP%203-35.1A%20z.pdf). Full of interesting tidbits, useful for the most intense camping trip of all time. Ctrl-F for "swearing".

{% newthought "Are the British a joke of a nuclear power?" %} (I love you guys, I promise.) Literally, yes — have you heard about [Blue Peacock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Peacock) and the chicken-powered nuclear bomb? Of course, they couldn't be normal about it: 

> This proposal was sufficiently outlandish that it was taken as an April Fool's Day joke when the Blue Peacock file was declassified on 1 April 2004. Tom O'Leary, head of education and interpretation at the National Archives, replied to the media that, "It does seem like an April Fool but it most certainly is not. The Civil Service does not do jokes."

We can't take the UK seriously, not because they once thought about building a chicken bomb, but because they didn't build a chicken powered bomb!{% sidenote "arg-id" "[Arf arf!]({% sidenote "sidenote-id" "This is a random sidenote" %} )" %}  It's debatable whether we should be reverent towards the atom bomb, whether we should reify and fear and treat it as sacred — but we should not mock it.
