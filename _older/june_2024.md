### Notes on Nepal

What’s up with road construction here? Why do highways get paved like this, for a 500m stretch with terrible dirt in between. How is this efficient. 
Lots of Bridges to nowhere. Right next to functioning but bumpy bridges. How different in the monsoon or snowmelt sessions
What are normal aspects of your car to advertise?

Tunnel to Kathmandu west side is behind schedule. Built by Japanese firm. 

Interesting form of traffic backups. Especially on the cliff side roads, not wide enough. So you get the equivalent of a temporary traffic light. But enforced by norms and risk tolerances — traffic in one direction stops when one truck thinks they can’t make a corner against the stopped oncoming vehicles
Absolutely impeccable surgical mask discipline among traffic cops

Motorcycles make sense with shit roads

Buses are available as comfy as any vamoose but the comfort is cancelled out by the quality of the roads. Reading is hard but possible. 

Urban rural differences between Tibet and Nepal. Highways are entirely urbanized but only up to fifty meters back from the road.
Concentration on highways is only possible where the road is on flat enough ground. 
Lots of villages tucked away in valleys? See Papúa New Guinea

Buddhists prosyltize?

Heavily militarized. Gorkhas in Pokhara. Who fights for Nepal?
Geneva convention on gorkhas?

Maoists? Where are they? 

Terrible Wikipedia pages.

Open Phil used Nepal/India as an example of an open border with large disparity in income. Probably because Nepal is so Muchvless urbanized. Don’t know much about labor flows




When we took off from Delhi, the Temperature above the tarmac (macadam) was over 120 F. We performed a radical dogleg around the Wakhan corridor. Sitting on the left of the plane, I had a steep view of the first Himalayas I ever met.

My friends leaving Kathmandu towards the east, towards guangzhou and chengdu, immediately bumped up to FL35. My flight to Delhi was relatively downhill. 

Heading northeast towards Europe from Delhi however requires a bump. This bump is the Pakistani Chinese plateau, the most rugged bits of xingjiang.

## Reading

Book: the birth of Korean cool. 

A bit of a memoir. Good Interviews. Cuisine. K pop. K dramas. K cinema. 

Focus on not being first but being best. There’s a core explanation of the k pop phenomenon. Less for tv and film. Part of it is “culture” — Asian cultures (Japan and China) view Korean men as good romantic partners.also Koreans have a tragedy in their history. 

Ridiculous homogeneity. Paid off the 1997 imf loan three years ahead of schedule — by soliciting donations from taxpayers. Tons of gold from jewelry turned in. 

Sort of thing — ministry of culture — which would work well in a dictatorship. But continue to work well (better!) after late 80s democracy. 

The book doesn’t find a through line though it hints at one. How does the government coordinate these? Dive into the “five year plans”. Courts? Patented choreography.

Book: Workikg by Caro. 

He says early on that in both the loses and lbj books he uses the pronoun “I” fewer than a dozen times. This book is about all the “I”s he omits. 

The majority is on interviewing. He is a persistently annoying interviewer — he would repeat “what did you see” and “what did you hear” over and over again until some interviewees would kicks him out. 

Access is varying. Some subjects would decline interviews until they realized how persistent he was, or until they had nothing to lose. Moses had shut down, according to caro, a dozen biographies before he came along. And Moses’s circle tried to prevent others from talking to him as long as they could — until caro was invited eventually for a series of interviews. 

Similar with southern democratic senators who mentored or worked with Lbj, and were eventually betrayed by him in the civil rights act of 1964. One wouldn’t talk to caro until he was on his deathbed. 

Caro writes about his life as if it’s a normal CV — journalism,then books. But no. He’s 77 (?) years old when this book comes out and his life is simply a short education and two projects. He attempts to place this as normal, or even more normal than other researchers, by placing himself in the context of other writers in the NYPL special room. It doesn’t work. That was for Moses, which ended up longer than any of them. Lbj dwarfs that. 

This is a short book. But it explains Caro’s fascination with these two characters fully. The reason to read the power broker or the lbj years is not for those two people — Wikipedia suffices. The reason is for Caro’s care, diligence, and obsession. For that, the pronoun “I” is useful.


Book: The General, CS Forester. 

A fictional biography of a British lieutenant general on the western front in wwi. At his height, he had 100,000 troops under him. A relic of the old army, very thoroughly painted. Not creative in the least — a brave, simple soldier who is quite talented at following orders. Severe, inspiring by accident. Forester condemns, but acknowledges how well and good this model of general inspires in soldiers. 

The frame story, of Curzon (no particular reason for the name) in his old age on the promenade at Bournemouth, is intended as pathos. All men, even the greatest, End up there. But forester doesn’t execute this as neatly as he could. Earlier in the book, Curzon relieves an elderly general of command, having vaulted from major to brigadier in a few weeks. Perhaps this isn’t meant as a premonition — forester writes that Curzon’s impression of the old man (that he should not have been given command) is accurate, and forester implies something quite different of curzon’s time as general (simple but inspiring and effective). 

I see the frame as worthwhile. Curzon served well, lived truly, loved fully. His reward for a fine.
