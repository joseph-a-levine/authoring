## Updates

The "weird" part of my PhD is mostly wrapped up. I have an exam{% sidenote "last-id" "Probably my last school exam ever?" %}  the first week of June, and then I head to The Gambia for a few weeks of field work. 

My next three years are very much like a typical American PhD: head-down research, only emerge for seminars, "a good dissertation is a finished dissertation," etc. This is a bit of a relief: the first two years of the [MPhil+DPhil](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/mphil-dphil-in-economics) were rather odd, owing to the somewhat confused expectations of research, coursework, and departmental standing for our cohort. The integrated MPhil+DPhil is a *new* degree, we're only the second cohort, and the administration is still figuring things out.{% sidenote "udn-id" "My undergrad was weird for a similar reason; when I started, no class had graduated from the joint degree program." %}  

I haven't minded the chaos -- if anything, it has given us greater freedom to explore research paths and not overburdened us with coursework. Especially in a town as hidebound as Oxford, an unfinished rulebook provides a lot of leeway. Already, the administrative hiccoughs are being resolved; the two cohorts which have followed us are going to have an easier and less confusing time of it! 

I'll be in DC for most of July! Please [reach out](https://jablevine.com/hi/) if you want to catch up. I'll also be at the Economics of Animal Welfare Conference at Brown. 



### Notes on Nepal

I spent three weeks of May in Nepal with MWG and her friends from Tsinghua. We had five days in Kathmandu, two days in Pokhara, and two weeks scrambling over Himalayas. The country and weather was beautiful. Some disconnected thoughts:

What’s up with road construction in Nepal? We spent more than 40 hours on highways. The typical ride is about 500m of paved road, followed by five kilometers of potted dirt, then another paved section, then repeat. The work continues --- I saw more road crews per kilometer than any American or European highway. The paved sections seem chosen at random: some on ascents or descents, some close to a river or far, some close to towns. There are also lots of bridges to nowhere, right next to functioning but bumpy bridges. 

The rides were, despite this, comfortable enough. Most of the buses we sat on were as comfortable as any bus between DC and NY, and the seats were often larger. Although the roads were often as bad as those in [Sierra Leone](https://jablevine.com/older/november_2021), I never had to resort to audio books.

These highways have an interesting type of traffic backup, especially on cliff-side roads with tight corners. It seems like the equivalent of a temporary traffic light, but enforced by norms and risk tolerance. As we approached a corner, traffic in one direction would stop once a truck thinks they can't make a corner against the waiting oncoming vehicles. Then it's the turn of the other direction, until one of *their* vehicles gets spooked by the corner, and the waiting truck gets to try their luck. Sometimes we would pause for fifteen minutes waiting for one of these games of chicken to reverse the flow.{% sidenote "lhs-id" "Related, in India I noticed that being legally a left-hand-traffic country means little when when your roads are pocked and crowded. It was the same in Nepal: cars will drive on the left, right, and center to reduce bumps." %} Nepal does have a large corps of traffic police,{% sidenote "amsk-id" "There was absolutely impeccable mask discipline among these traffic police, presumably for dust reasons." %}  but they would rarely be at these chokepoints.

What are normal characteristics of your car to advertise (Lancaster 1966)? In Nepal, almost all billboards chose ground clearance.{% sidenote "ev-id" "Chinese electric vehicles are *everywhere*. MWG and I saw a lot of these in Central Asia last summer; the curve feels steep." %}  

A puzzle I discussed with BB and RD, especially on the long drives, was the urban-rural differences between Tibet and Nepal. Nepal has about 10x the population of the Tibet Autonomous Region, but Tibet is much more heavily urbanized: 15% of Tibet's population lives in its capital, compared to 3% of Nepal's. The boring explanation is political factors. More interesting is the industrialization, infrastructure, and productivity angle. The roads in Tibet are not like the roads in Nepal, and Tibet has Chinese passenger and freight rail (Nepal has none). The standard spatial economics argument (Krugman 1991, Fujita et al. 1999) is that cheaper transportation strengthens the city: the relative benefit of producing a widget in your rural village falls with the cost of buying a big-city widget. 

Nepal seems like a geography given to dispersion.{% sidenote "pan-id" "Much like Papua New Guinea, which is so mountainous it [forgot about half](https://www.ft.com/content/5a1a8d10-d2cd-4467-b877-06146cdb48e1) its population in 2022." %} However, I was suprised by the amount of lowlands: it is a country with a top half and a bottom half. Most of the population lives south of the Himalyas, close to India. The correct comparison for these agricultural regions is not Tibet, but Uttar Pradesh.{% sidenote "ups-id" "This mostly lines up with economic reality: the average Nepali is  slightly richer than the average UP, and both are *much* poorer than the average Tibetan. I've spent time in rural UP, but we didn't visit any rural parts of low Nepal. " %} 

This leads to the question of migration. Nepalis can cross into India and work without any authorization, and India *as a whole* is twice as rich per capita as Nepal. Anecdotally, I didn't meet any Nepalis who traveled to India to work, and I met many who traveled to the UAE, Poland, Qatar.{% sidenote "sele-id" "Beware the selection, etc." %}  I'm not surprised by the equilibrium (the benefits of working in India aren't particularly large), but it does put a damper on reducing migration barriers *between* low-income countries.

I have various other notes on proselytizing Buddhists, the Geneva convention's exception for Gorkhas, and the only democratically-elected Maoist head of state in the world. Maybe enough for another post!

All that's left is to write about is the leaving. My friends flew east from Kathmandu, towards Guangzhou and Chengdu. These flights cross the bulk of the Himalayas, and as the monsoon strengthens, they fly well above 35,000 feet. My flight to Delhi was relatively downhill. 

When we took off towards London from Delhi, the temperature above the tarmac{% sidenote "macet-id" "A fun etymology, coming from tarmacadam. Macadam is a paving mixture of gravel and dust, invented by a guy named MacAdam. When you mix tar with macadam, the dust doesn't escape. No one uses tarmac anymore, tho, it's all concrete." %}  was over 120 F. My flight was beautiful: we performed a radical dogleg around the Wakhan corridor to avoid Afghan airspace. Sitting on the left of the plane, I had a steep view of the first Himalayas I ever met. 

## Reading

Book: the birth of Korean cool. 

A bit of a memoir. Good Interviews. Cuisine. K pop. K dramas. K cinema. 

Focus on not being first but being best. There’s a core explanation of the k pop phenomenon. Less for tv and film. Part of it is “culture” — Asian cultures (Japan and China) view Korean men as good romantic partners.also Koreans have a tragedy in their history. 

Ridiculous homogeneity. Paid off the 1997 imf loan three years ahead of schedule — by soliciting donations from taxpayers. Tons of gold from jewelry turned in. 

Sort of thing — ministry of culture — which would work well in a dictatorship. But continue to work well (better!) after late 80s democracy. 

The book doesn’t find a through line though it hints at one. How does the government coordinate these? Dive into the “five year plans”. Courts? Patented choreography.

Book: Workikg by Caro. 

He says early on that in both the loses and lbj books he uses the pronoun “I” fewer than a dozen times. This book is about all the “I”s he omits. 

The majority is on interviewing. He is a persistently annoying interviewer — he would repeat “what did you see” and “what did you hear” over and over again until some interviewees would kicks him out. 

Access is varying. Some subjects would decline interviews until they realized how persistent he was, or until they had nothing to lose. Moses had shut down, according to caro, a dozen biographies before he came along. And Moses’s circle tried to prevent others from talking to him as long as they could — until caro was invited eventually for a series of interviews. 

Similar with southern democratic senators who mentored or worked with Lbj, and were eventually betrayed by him in the civil rights act of 1964. One wouldn’t talk to caro until he was on his deathbed. 

Caro writes about his life as if it’s a normal CV — journalism,then books. But no. He’s 77 (?) years old when this book comes out and his life is simply a short education and two projects. He attempts to place this as normal, or even more normal than other researchers, by placing himself in the context of other writers in the NYPL special room. It doesn’t work. That was for Moses, which ended up longer than any of them. Lbj dwarfs that. 

This is a short book. But it explains Caro’s fascination with these two characters fully. The reason to read the power broker or the lbj years is not for those two people — Wikipedia suffices. The reason is for Caro’s care, diligence, and obsession. For that, the pronoun “I” is useful.


Book: The General, CS Forester. 

A fictional biography of a British lieutenant general on the western front in wwi. At his height, he had 100,000 troops under him. A relic of the old army, very thoroughly painted. Not creative in the least — a brave, simple soldier who is quite talented at following orders. Severe, inspiring by accident. Forester condemns, but acknowledges how well and good this model of general inspires in soldiers. 

The frame story, of Curzon (no particular reason for the name) in his old age on the promenade at Bournemouth, is intended as pathos. All men, even the greatest, End up there. But forester doesn’t execute this as neatly as he could. Earlier in the book, Curzon relieves an elderly general of command, having vaulted from major to brigadier in a few weeks. Perhaps this isn’t meant as a premonition — forester writes that Curzon’s impression of the old man (that he should not have been given command) is accurate, and forester implies something quite different of curzon’s time as general (simple but inspiring and effective). 

I see the frame as worthwhile. Curzon served well, lived truly, loved fully. His reward for a fine.
