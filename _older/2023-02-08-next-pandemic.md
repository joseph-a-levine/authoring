*I am fairly worried about the H5N1 news. It's unlikely to be ≥ covid, but my information diet over the past week has me wondering — when I think backwards on the next pandemic, what will be my first recollection?*

I spent the first weekend of January 2020 in at an academic conference in Puerto Rico. My first memory of the Covid pandemic{% sidenote "confak-id" "I also have a strong memory, surely constructed, standing on the steps of my aunt's house in Morgantown, West Virginia on November 23rd, 2019, speaking to one of her Ph.D. students from Wuhan.

At the time, this seemed like a minor concern. My previous exposures to potential pandemics had been outbreaks of swine flu or ... which fizzled out after a few months and a few thousand deaths. In fact, when I thought of public health disasters, I was much more likely to think of infrastructural tragedies — Flint's pipes, or Chipotle's E. Coli. Furthermore, Puerto Rico had been hit by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake just two days before the conference, and most of the city was without power when I landed. There were much more urgent disasters looming than an outbreak of pneumonia in a city I'd never heard of.
