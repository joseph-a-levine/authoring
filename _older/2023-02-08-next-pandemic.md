*I am fairly worried about the H5N1 news. It's unlikely to be ≥ covid, but my information diet over the past week has me wondering — when I think backwards on the next pandemic, what will be my first recollection?*

I spent the first weekend of January 2020 in at an academic conference in Puerto Rico. My first memory of the Covid pandemic{% sidenote "confak-id" "I also have a strong memory, surely constructed, standing on the steps of my aunt's house in Morgantown, West Virginia on November 23rd, 2019, speaking to one of her Ph.D. students from Wuhan. " %} came while drinking something sweet and coconutty on a terrace over the Laguna del Condado — an academic used to flying between Beijing and New York{% sidenote "grcirfli-id" "I really want to take this flight someday, in the summer. Look [at this](http://gc.kls2.com/cgi-bin/gc?PATH=PEK-JFK&RANGE=&PATH-COLOR=red&PATH-UNITS=nm&PATH-MINIMUM=&SPEED-GROUND=&SPEED-UNITS=kts&RANGE-STYLE=best&RANGE-COLOR=navy&MAP-STYLE=) gorgeous great circle. Unfortunately, there are no direct flights from Argentina to Australia. " %} was complaining about the somewhat invasive health measures being implemented on his last trip. 

At the time, a  seemed like a minor concern. My previous exposures to potential pandemics had been outbreaks of swine flu or SARS which fizzled out after a few months and a few thousand deaths. In fact, when I thought of public health disasters, the examples which came to mind were infrastructural tragedies — Flint's pipes, or Chipotle's E. Coli. Furthermore, Puerto Rico had been hit by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake just two days before the conference, and most of the city was without power when I landed. There were much more urgent disasters looming than an outbreak of pneumonia in a city I'd never heard of. 

I got lucky with Covid — the first news articles about the outbreak mostly came weeks later. 

Since then, two things have changed. First, there are far more watchers, on Twitter, elsewhere

Second, the composition of my social circle has changed.

There are strong social incentives to speak up about the next pandemic — monkeypox being the last example.

I first heard about H5N1 on Sunday, 5 February, from a wildlife biology friend. My first news source was [Zeynep](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/opinion/bird-flu-h5n1-pandemic.html), predictably, and the nascent [Metaculus market](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/15025/who-pheic-declaration-on-h5n1/) soon after. 

I'm pretty happy with this — I learned about a potential pandemic before the first human case{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "This is a random sidenote" %} and before the first case of human-to-human transmission, which are the barriers to this becoming something worth worrying about. If anything, I feel *overexposed* to news about potential pandemics. On the time scale of the news cycle, pandemics move slowly.

What would I do if I learned about a potential pandemic? I've been in this situation — asking myself, should I take any action with this information? — three times now. And the answer has been "no" all three times. With a small exception last summer,{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "This is a random sidenote" %} my response to learning about a new viral sword of Damocles has been to continue with my life. 

(Should *you* do anything when you hear about an emerging pandemic? If you're a policymaker, yes, definitely, stop reading this blog and go do something. Idk what, ask Zeynep or Zvi. But for everyone else, my advice would be painfully generic. Protect your immune system [diet, sleep] and overall health [lose weight through diet and exercise at a healthy rate]. This is a good idea regardless of whatever new virus is coming down the track, but the prospect of pneumonia can be motivating. We all have strong incentives to freeride on reducing transmission in a population, but reducing your chances of getting very sick depends mostly on you.)

I'm not sure what information would cause me to take action.

All my methods of hearing about pandemics rely on high-level distillation efforts. I don't spend my time reading pre-prints or skimming APHIS databases,{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "With one exception — last year, I was looking for data on US milk" %} and I probably wouldn't understand these sources deeply enough to spot problems before they emerge. Zeynep's NYT Opinion piece was sourced with pre-prints, interviews with virologists, and years of background knowledge. 

Larger concern — will vigilance fade?

*Note* — I wrote the above on 9-10 February, and any forecasts represent my views on tho
