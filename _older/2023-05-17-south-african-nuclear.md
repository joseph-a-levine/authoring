South Africa is the only country that has developed nuclear weapons and then voluntarily dismantled them. In 1991, in their last years of their rule, the Afrikaaner government dismantled their six nuclear bombs. 

I claim this is a unique, impressive, important moment in history. Never before or since has a country spent such   a ridiculous amount of money and effort on such a thing, gotten that thing, looked at the thing, and immediately said, "Nope, never mind, we don't want that thing anymore."{% sidenote "cou-id" "OK, counterexamples. " %}

Why is the South African decision so important? Because nuclear weapons are special; they're nothing else like them. REWRITE In the 1990s, the US Office of Technology Assessment concluded that the cheapest overt production route for 1 nuclear bomb per year, with no international controls, would cost ~$200 million. They also concluded that a chemical weapons arsenal for substantial military capability would cost $10s of millions. They concluded that a large biological weapons arsenal may cost less than $10 million.{% sidenote "cossideda-id" "Dando, 2006" %}

But — there is something like them. Parallels between nuclear weapons and AGI proliferate,{% sidenote "exampro-id" "Examples of comparisons between nukes and AGI" %} many without substance. 

Here, I'm going to look at South Africa's history building and dismantling nuclear weapons, the many things we can't learn from this episode, and the few we can. 

## Why South Africa wanted nuclear weapons

Who wouldn't? 

## Why gave them up

Money
End of cold war
Racism
