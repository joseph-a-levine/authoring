title: Say Hi
---
{% newthought 'This is a small website,'%} with very few things on it. If you ended up here, we'd probably have an interesting conversation and you should say hi. You can reach me by email at <a href="mailto:jablevine@gmail.com">jablevine@gmail.com</a> or put some time on my Calendly. I am very good at responding to email, but I only check my inbox at 7am and 6pm; if I haven't replied within 36 hours, you should follow up, [repeatedly](https://guzey.com/follow-up/).

I have shamelessly copied this gimmick from [Ben Kuhn](https://www.benkuhn.net/hi/).

<!-- Calendly inline widget begin -->
<div class="calendly-inline-widget" data-url="https://calendly.com/jablevine?hide_gdpr_banner=1" style="min-width:220px;height:650px;"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js" async></script>
<!-- Calendly inline widget end -->
