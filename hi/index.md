title: Say Hi
---
{% newthought 'This is a small website,'%} with very few things on it. If you ended up here, we'd probably have an interesting conversation and you should say hi. You can reach me by email at <a href="mailto:jablevine@gmail.com">jablevine@gmail.com</a> or put some time on my Calendly. I am very good at responding to email, but I only check my inbox twice a day; if I haven't replied within a couple of days you should follow up, [repeatedly](https://guzey.com/follow-up/). You can also give me anonymous feedback [here](https://www.admonymous.co/jablevine).

I am in Oxford most of the year, and would be very happy to meet in person!
