District Chophouse, the only restaurant outside of security in the main terminal of Dulles International Airport, is a weird place. In my two hours at the centre-most table, I saw:

- a flight attendant in her first week on the job, trying desperately for ten minutes to order a chicken ceasar salad, only to end up with *three* chicken ceasar salads;
- three of the palest ex-Marine's i've ever seen, discussing Azerbaijan's export policies in Virginia drawls;
- the largest 2pm pours of Merlot I've seen since freshman year; seriously, some of these people were wearing white to fly and it was dangerous;
- presumably at least a few spies of differing nationalities â€” if you want to meet with an agent before they flee the country, without subjecting yourself to the rigours of our TSA, this is an ideal spot. 

So what brought me here, drinking a $13 Blue Moon? A three hour layover, and the prospect of not seeing my mom until she flies over to Oxford once the weather turns pleasant.
