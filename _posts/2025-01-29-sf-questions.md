This was my first extended trip to the San Francisco Bay Area and I have questions. Some of these have simple answers; others are entire research agendas. I would be interested to talk more about any of these!

{% newthought "What are all the different" %} types of self-driving cars in the city? The Waymo cars are most common, and the Amazon Zoox are labeled, but there were at least five other form factors around the city which I didn't recognize. I looked for a birder's-guide to self-driving cars and couldn't find one. 

{% newthought "What is Waymo's relationship" %} to the city? How did the negotiations to begin commercial operations go here? Was it easier here than Phoenix or LA? Is there a full-time Waymo employee sitting in the SF MTA offices? How closely do they share data?

{% newthought "What does SF (and LA and Phoenix)" %} get from Waymo? Some American cities are using uber data to identify potholes; Waymo data are much richer. I don't want to give each city hundreds of mobile speed cameras, but increased sensors and visibility into the city would be great. 

{% newthought "What's up with " %} all this housing on public land? We passed a [few dozen houses](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KfCmjMHXeRsHh1nv5) in the Marin Headlands on National Park land; our first thought was that these were for park employees, but at least a few are owned by tech folk commuting to SF. 

{% newthought "Similarly, how does the" %} Presidio Trust work? I no longer think that it's the ideal spot for a [freedom city](https://www.city-journal.org/article/building-freedom-cities), but this is a unique example of converting National Park land to productive use. 

{% newthought "What would the Bay Area" %} look like if the transcontinental railroad had arrived before the Spanish galleons? The Presidio is a natural spot for a military post, but otherwise there would have been little initial attraction to the San Francisco peninsula; the center of economic activity would instead have been in Contra Costa. The Mexican-American War transferred California to American hands in 1848, and the gold rush began immediately after, so we don't have a chance to examine a Bay Area contested between land and sea.

{% newthought "When and why did the" %} last port facilities close in the West Bay? Was this done with the support of the port workers' union? Was it driven by the WWII ship-building boom in the East Bay? 

{% newthought "What lessons should we take from" %} the East Bay ship-building boom? Of course, the WWII boom was unique, but the largest shipyard in human history was in the San Francisco Bay. That's worth noticing!

{% newthought "Is port automation more or less" %} likely in Oakland relative to other major ports? More likely: proximity to tech sector which drives both norms and technology; less likely: increased truculence and obstructionism. 

{% newthought "Does the San Francisco Bay need" %} another bridge? The Bay Bridge was only rarely congested, so my instinct is no, but two bridges is very few for such a region, and bridges are cool! The logical place (purely my eyeballing a map) is between Bayview and south Oakland, two historically poor and black communities. 

{% newthought "Why doesn't the western span" %} of the Bay Bridge have a bike lane? You can bike from Treasure Island to Oakland, but not San Francisco. It's odd that this hasn't been fixed in this era. It would be a glorious ~50 mile loop over the Golden Gate and Richmond Bridges; a nice path there might even get me into cycling.

{% newthought "Is Treasure Island a pleasant" %} place to live? How about the apartment building on Yerba Buena? What's it like there? 

{% newthought "What would the Bay Area" %} be like today if land fill weren't abolished in 1965? I'm not asking about the [Reber Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reber_Plan); just the modest Oakland/Berkeley/Richmond city master plans of the 60s, giving each of those cities a modest 5-20% increase in land. 

Lastly, a question I posed in my post on Berkeley: 

{% newthought "How should we reconcile" %} UC Berkeley's well-earned radical reputation and its ties to military research and production. This question was inspired by a recent trip to Bristol, UK, which is also a radical city (they have a Green MP!), and also produces 4% of the world's arms. See Gavin Leech's notes on that city [here](https://www.gleech.org/bristol). Is this a general phenomenon? Do protestors trivially follow weapons manufacture? Is this all a function of education? Does anyone have other examples/counterexamples?
