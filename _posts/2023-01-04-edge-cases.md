My cohort-mate Elodie Chervin, a tall Frenchwoman with a better American accent than mine, presented in December a paper she had worked on as a research assistant for Zach Cooper at Yale.{% sidenote "notemexl" "The notebook with my notes from Elodie's talk mysteriously disappeared in Mexico (not mysterious, it was stolen from a rental car after the back window was smashed in). And I'm not going to actually read the paper; grad students don't have time for that. So this is mostly based on memory." %}
