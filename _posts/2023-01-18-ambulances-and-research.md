My cohort-mate Elodie Chervin, a tall Frenchwoman with a better American accent than mine, presented in December a [paper](https://jablevine.com/papers/Cooper%20et%20al_2022_Do%20Higher-Priced%20Hospitals%20Deliver%20Higher-Quality%20Care.pdf) she had worked on as a research assistant for Zach Cooper at Yale.{% sidenote "notemexl" "The notebook with my notes from Elodie's talk mysteriously disappeared in Mexico (not mysterious, it was stolen from a rental car after the back window was smashed in). And I'm not going to actually read the paper; grad students don't have time for that. So this is mostly based on memory." %} The paper is called "Do Higher-Priced Hospitals Deliver Higher-Quality Care?," and finds positive results, with a caveat for market concentration. 

"Hospital markets are increasingly consolidated"

mergers —> consolidation —> less competition —> increased prices

so having higher prices makes you a better hospital (lol causality) in competitive markets, but not consolidated markets

this is convincing as the driver of this famous graph

An aside — one of my soapboxes is the increasing fraction of for-profit nursing homes.
