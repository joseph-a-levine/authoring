OK, this has to be a proper README. I'm going to want to update this website over the next few years, and I will forget how to do that if I want this to go well.

I'm tearing this apart, and I don't really know what I'm doing. The good news is that if I ever want to go back to how the Jekyll template looks, I can go download that [here](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll).

## Navigation Bar

The navigation bar was set up to pull in each "page". Which is fine, because I created a bunch of pages. But in the template it was a loop which found every page folder and created a navigation bar to that page. I don't expect my navigation bar to change often enough to require this, so I'm going to try to define each option. 

As of 2021-04-25, the _includes\header file individually lists out each page I want people to be able to go to. If I want to add a page to the navigation bar, I'll have to go in and manually copy the link. It's pretty self explanatory what to do. But this is supposed to be a minimalist website, so don't go adding a thousand things to the navigation bar. 

## Research page

I'm just going for aesthetics here. I should probably customize the fonts at some point to get everything looking like I want it to, but this is fine. If you can think of a better way to get the abstracts and titles and co-authors to line up well, go for it by all means. 


## Now page

What the heck am I doing, this should be a proper blog. But no i'm going super static.

## Favicon

Used this website to generate the favicon and i *followed the instructions*. https://realfavicongenerator.net/faq#.YIZ3LpD7Q2w
