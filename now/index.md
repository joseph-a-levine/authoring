title: What am I up to now?
---

I stopped publishing updates here late last fall on near-universal advice. Maybe it was my half-hearted advocacy for ecoterrorism or excessive references to the health problems which came from living in West Africa, but academic mentors, family, and friends thought perhaps these updates wouldn't endear me to PhD admissions committees.

That's no longer an issue: I'll be starting the PhD{% sidenote "phd" "Not actually a PhD. Technically it's the ''[Integrated DPhil (2+2) in economics](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/mphil-dphil-economics#:~:text=The%20structure%20of%20the%20MPhil%20%2B%20DPhil%20programme%20is%20similar%20to%20that%20of%20the%20integrated%20five%2Dyear%20PhD%20(sometimes%20called%20MRes%2DPhD)%20at%20leading%20economics%20graduate%20schools%20worldwide.),'' because Oxford just *has* to be special ðŸ™„. I'm going to keep calling it a PhD until someone yells at me. See my [homepage](jablevine.com) for the canonical version of this caveat." %} in economics at the University of Oxford in October. I was in Oxford for all of February-June, besides one weekend in Boston and a week-long road trip in Scotland. Oxford is a great town, and I'm excited to really settle down for the first time since high school. 

Much of my love for Oxford is due to the great people based at the Trajan House offices where I have worked. Trajan House is the headquarters of CEA, FHI, Forethought Foundation, GovAI, GPI, and many other organizations with similarly opaque names. My host organization, GPI, has been a perfect place to expand out of development economics and back into the economics which will make up my academic short term future. My visit at GPI came to an end in early July, with the conclusion of two workshops. I write more about my work at GPI and these workshops in the "Research" section below.

Since late June, I met three people who asked me why I stopped writing my book reviews {% sidenote "coy" "No one asked what diseases I'd contracted recently." %}. I never stopped writing them; I just stopped uploading them! Also, because I was too lazy to set up Google Analytics, I had assumed the only people who read this page were my dad and his friends from high school whom he shared it with.{% sidenote "bacon" "Hi Susan, hi Ron." %} Having been proven wrong, I suppose it's time to get started again.

## Travel

On 25 June, I started a nine-week, six-city{% sidenote "town" "And two small coastal towns." %}  tour. While it's impossible to list all the highlights and excitement, here is a series of one-shots:

### Bern

Bern was the first stop on my two-month lark. I was attending a week-long workshop on existential risks at a meditation retreat east of the city,{% sidenote "yoga" "Presumably so we could max out on calmness while considering the end of the world." %}  with a couple of days before and after to explore. My first two days were full touristy, swimming in the Aare, drinking in Einstein's house{% sidenote "annus" "Where he had his *[annus mirabilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_mirabilis_papers)*." %} (now converted into a bar), and seeing the sights with a history buff/friend who grew up in the city. The weather could not have been more beautiful for early summer; while this possibly confounds my opinion, Bern is solidly in my top five favorite cities I've visited.

By the end of day two, following the absolutely worst seminar on public choice I've ever experienced,{% sidenote "voting" "No one's fault: after the workshop opening dinner, the organizers presented three options for a closing activity: Hike, Swim, and Waterfall. JOSEPH " %} I was starting to feel a bit tired. But on the morning of the next day conference, I woke up [REDACTED REDACTED] sick enough to miss the entirety of the workshop and visit the hospital on days three and four. 

While the doctor wasn't able to provide a final diagnosis,{% sidenote "specif" "I tested negative for everything she could think of." %} the only disease she suspected (for gross reasons) which she _couldn't_ test for was monkeypox.{% sidenote "capac" "At the time, Switzerland had no monkeypox testing capacity." %} By the morning of day five, however, I was on the mend, and the doctor decided that even if it were monkeypox, I'd no longer be contagious and that I should just *get out of her country*. 

### DC 

After a pit stop in Oxford to stash my life's belongings under my office desk, I flew to DC for a week. Besides catching up with friends and old colleagues, the highlight of the trip home was an evening tour of the monuments with my aunt and her niece.{% sidenote "relat" "My half second cousin once removed?" %} DC is not known for its natural beauty; it's the giant mounds of marble which pull any tourists. But that night, the DC sky outdid itself. A [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2022/07/12/dc-sunset-rainbows-lightning-red/) article the next day collected pictures from around the area but my family and I had the best view.{% marginfigure "tj" "assets/img/tj.jpg" "From my mom's iPhone." %} 

We sat in the Thomas Jefferson memorial for a half hour, watching the sunset linger behind lightning and rainbows. This was the first time I had been back to TJ since my pre-high school prom pictures, so I have a pretty high bar for visiting again.{% sidenote "engag" "Last month, my prom date got engaged! Congrats Taylor & Connor!" %}

### Oregon

The next stop was Portland and Eugene, to visit my amazing sister, who definitely lives far away from where she went to college. On my last day there, we went to the World Athletics Championships, held for the first time in the US. There was some fun javelin and long jump, but the highlight of the night was definitely the finals for the women's 5000m and the 4x100m relays. JOSEPH

A track 5k is incredibly boring at the World Championships, unless your life's passion is watching the 20 lankiest stringbeans with phenomenal lung capacity run at 80% for 10-12 minutes, then sprint like crazy for 2-4 minutes. Thankfully, that *is* my sister's life's passion, and I got a delightful running commentary{% sidenote "runn" "Do you get it?" %} of every shimmy and pass and "Oh my gosh what happened to Karissa??"{% marginnote "convin" "*Joseph*: Are you sure you want me to come? I don't know anything about track, you'll have to explain everything to me. %} After a long and boring tactical race, three Ethiopians and two Kenyans ran away with it in the last 200 meters. The winner, Gudaf Tsegay, is a surprisingly{% sidenote "tome" "To me, at least." %}  versatile runner, holding top ten times between 800 and 10,000 meters. She's also Tigray. In the stands that day were dozens of Tigrayan-Americans; there were certainly more Tigrayan flags than Ethiopian flags waving. After Tsegay crossed the finish line, followed by Letesenbet Gidey in fifth, one of these spectators ran onto the track with a Tigray flag, lifted both Tsegay and Gidey in the air, and handed them the flag before being detained by security. 

### Glacier Bay National Park

I flew from Eugene to Gustavus, AK next â€” my friend Lucas Wolfman{% marginfigure "wolfman" "assets/img/wolfman.jpg" "" %}  is finishing up his masters dissertation in this off-the-grid town of 400 people, and his partner Hailey is a park ranger at the National Park.{% sidenote "hat" "With the big hat and everything." %} At Hailey's suggestion, I went out on the small dayboat, which trundles up the bay to the eponymous glaciers at 7am every morning. It was an absolutely perfect day, with views in all directions and wildlife everywhere. As famous naturalist and noted racist John Muir wrote upon stumbling into the Bay,

> sunshine streamed through the luminous fringes of the clouds and fell on the green waters of the fiord, the glittering bergs, the crystal bluffs of the vast glacier, the intensely white, far-spreading fields of ice, and the ineffably chaste and spiritual heights of the Fairweather Range, which were now hidden, now partly revealed, the whole making a picture of icy wildness unspeakably pure and sublime.

What an asshole. 

### Bay Area

After a one-day stop in Seattle, I arrived in San Francisco for a series of conferences, workshops, and baseball games. I won't list all of the amazing people I met or caught up with,{% sidenote "mani" "Except Riley, Oraya, and Manisha, who deserve special mention for prompting me to start writing here again." %} Instead, the far-and-away highlight of the week was 17 hours in Tahoe. Two serious climbing friends had found a wall and borrowed a Prius; I tagged around to provide moral support and look at pretty rocks. 

Late in the afternoon, we left the cliff face for a waterfall{% marginfigure "waterfall" "assets/img/waterfall.jpg" "" %} with a pool perfect for deepwater free solos.{% sidenote "dwfs" "If you fall 30 feet, you fall into water!" %} We finished the day swimming in Lake Tahoe and devouring the largest burritos east of the Mission.{% sidenote "weeh" "My first trip to SF is a good opportunity to recommend one of my favorite pieces of internet writing: [The Alameda-Weehawken Burrito Tunnel](https://idlewords.com/2007/04/the_alameda_weehawken_burrito_tunnel.htm)." %}

### Connecticut and New York

## Reading 

I read more books in 2021 than I expect to read in any other calendar year. I attribute this to: 
- Internet was sufficiently expensive in Sierra Leone to discourage all video streaming and marginal browsing, 
- Work stress was very high, so I escaped into books as frequently as I could.
- While I played football, hockey, and water polo socially, that was the extent of my social life. 

I won't read as much in 2022. But here are some of my favorites from the past couple of months.

### "Hitler's Uranium Club," Jeremy Bernstein

I re-read this book in June. The body is 250 pages of transcripts of conversations between ten of the best nuclear and chemical scientists under the Nazi regime, recorded secretly during their interment at Farm Hall outside Cambridge. 

### Stonehenge 

### Letters 

And, because I read Wodehouse like candy, I'll end with: 

## Listening

For a small city, Oxford has a Since March, I've seen three of the great symphonies performed by the Oxford Philharmonic. Tchaikovsky's 5th 

The Oxford Philharmonic performs in the Sheldonian Theatre, my favourite non-church designed by Wren. (Much preferred to the old hall at my semi-alma mater.) The concert hall in the Sheldonian is tiny, every seat feels cramped. But it is beatiful. From the top, down:
- The [ceiling mosaic](https://www.google.com/maps/@51.7543066,-1.254943,2a,16.5y,262.34h,160.05t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sjyKiW68fe05YzCrt_hIR5w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656), painted by Robert Streater in 1669 and restored in 2008, is titled "Triumph of Truth and Learning over Envy, Rapine, and Ignorance." I spent most of Tchaikovsky's 5th distracted by the ceiling. The main circle consists of anthropomorphized versions of the courses taught at Oxford in the 17th century: Poesy poses with pipes; Mosaical law holds a set of double tablets; Astronomy rests on a giant astrolabe (thanks, lucy, for figuring this one out with me); and Chemistry clutches a crucible. On the south side of the ceiling are the titular outcasts: Envy, covered insnakes, falls away from the circle of divine coursework. Rapine and Ignorance, I learned later, are not visible due to the...
- ...Organ installed in the 1880s, which reaches to the ceiling. While the organ is gorgeous, I was disappointed to learn the beautiful facade is now entirely decorative. From an uncited forum comment: 
> The organ was a 'Father' Willis of 1877. It was rebuilt by Willis III in 1927/8 to a design of H.P Allen, without any Swell reeds. Harrison & Harrison rebuilt it in 1963 with mutations and a Cromorne on the Choir organ, as was popular at that time.  
> 
> The heating baked the organ, so in 1997 one of the Oxford alumni (a QC,) donated a synthetic instrument. It is said that the pipework remains in situ, though the loudspeakers are concealed within the rather splendid T.G. Jackson case.
- I was seated directly under the stage-right [proctor's box](https://www.sheldonian.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/mt_image_medium_square/public/sheldonian/images/media/plasticgoldfish.co_.uk_9k5a98781.jpg?itok=qQa0xxDn) for Brahm's 1st symphony. I spent most of the intemission speculating with a friend (hi Anna) about the fasces-weilding lions, looking like something out of an Indiana Jones dungeon. The best theory we could come up with is that they are intended to intimidate students sitting their exam in the hall every June.

In mid-June, I returned to the Sheldonian for the Philharmonic's season closing, a performance of Beethoven's Choral Fantasy and Choral Symphony, his 9th. 

Before each of these performances, I met myfriends at the White Horse, one of the innumerable 7+ century old pubs scattered around Oxford. The main virtue of the White Horse is it's proximity to the Sheldonian.
