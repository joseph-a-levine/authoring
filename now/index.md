title: What am I up to now?
---

I stopped publishing updates here late last fall on near-universal advice. Maybe it was my half-hearted advocacy for ecoterrorism or excessive references to the health problems which came from living in West Africa, but academic mentors, family, and friends thought perhaps these updates wouldn't endear me to PhD admissions committees.

That's no longer an issue: I'll be starting the PhD{% sidenote "phd" "Not actually a PhD. Technically it's the ''Integrated DPhil (2+2) in economics,'' because Oxford just *has* to be special ðŸ™„. I'm going to keep calling it a PhD until someone yells at me. See my [homepage](jablevine.com) for the canonical version of this caveat." %} in economics at the University of Oxford in October. I was in Oxford for all of February-June, besides one weekend in Boston and a week-long road trip in Scotland. Oxford is a great town, and I'm excited to really settle down for the first time since high school. 

Much of my love for Oxford is due to the great people based at the Trajan House offices where I have worked. Trajan House is the headquarters of CEA, FHI, Forethought Foundation, GovAI, GPI, and many other organizations with similarly opaque names. My host organization, GPI, has been a perfect place to expand out of development economics and back into the economics which will make up my academic short term future. My visit at GPI came to an end in early July, with the conclusion of two workshops. I write more about my work at GPI and these workshops in the "Research" section below.

Since late June, I met three people for the first time who asked me why I stopped writing my book reviews {% sidenote "coy" "No one asked what diseases I'd contracted recently." %}. I never stopped writing them; I just stopped uploading them!

## Reading 

I read more books in 2021 than I expect to read in any other calendar year. I attribute this to several causes: 

I won't read as much in 2022. But here are some of my favorites from the past couple of months.

### Stonehenge 

### Letters 

And, because I read Wodehouse like candy, I'll end with: 

## Listening

For a small city, Oxford has a Since March, I've seen three of the great symphonies performed by the Oxford Philharmonic. Tchaikovsky's 5th 

The Oxford Philharmonic performs in the Sheldonian Theatre, my favourite non-church designed by Wren. (Much preferred to the old hall at my semi-alma mater.) The concert hall in the Sheldonian is tiny, every seat feels cramped. But it is beatiful. From the top, down:
- The [ceiling mosaic](https://www.google.com/maps/@51.7543066,-1.254943,2a,16.5y,262.34h,160.05t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sjyKiW68fe05YzCrt_hIR5w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656), painted by Robert Streater in 1669 and restored in 2008, is titled "Triumph of Truth and Learning over Envy, Rapine, and Ignorance." I spent most of Tchaikovsky's 5th distracted by the ceiling. The main circle consists of anthropomorphized versions of the courses taught at Oxford in the 17th century: Poesy poses with pipes; Mosaical law holds a set of double tablets; Astronomy rests on a giant astrolabe (thanks, lucy, for figuring this one out with me); and Chemistry clutches a crucible. On the south side of the ceiling are the titular outcasts: Envy, covered insnakes, falls away from the circle of divine coursework. Rapine and Ignorance, I learned later, are not visible due to the...
- ...Organ installed in the 1880s, which reaches to the ceiling. While the organ is gorgeous, I was disappointed to learn the beautiful facade is now entirely decorative. From an uncited forum comment: 
> The organ was a 'Father' Willis of 1877. It was rebuilt by Willis III in 1927/8 to a design of H.P Allen, without any Swell reeds. Harrison & Harrison rebuilt it in 1963 with mutations and a Cromorne on the Choir organ, as was popular at that time.  
> 
> The heating baked the organ, so in 1997 one of the Oxford alumni (a QC,) donated a synthetic instrument. It is said that the pipework remains in situ, though the loudspeakers are concealed within the rather splendid T.G. Jackson case.
- I was seated directly under the stage-right [proctor's box](https://www.sheldonian.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/mt_image_medium_square/public/sheldonian/images/media/plasticgoldfish.co_.uk_9k5a98781.jpg?itok=qQa0xxDn) for Brahm's 1st symphony. I spent most of the intemission speculating with a friend (hi Anna) about the fasces-weilding lions, looking like something out of an Indiana Jones dungeon. The best theory we could come up with is that they are intended to intimidate students sitting their exam in the hall every June.

In mid-June, I returned to the Sheldonian for the Philharmonic's season closing, a performance of Beethoven's Choral Fantasy and Choral Symphony, his 9th. 

Before each of these performances, I met myfriends at the White Horse, one of the innumerable 7+ century old pubs scattered around Oxford. The main virtue of the White Horse is it's proximity to the Sheldonian.
