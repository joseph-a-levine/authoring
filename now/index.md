title: What am I up to now?

## October, 2021

October is my favorite month. My birthday, Halloween, Sukkot, MLB postseason, a spike in fiction releases, all add up to a great few weeks. Now, in Sierra Leone, I'm  realizing how much I underrated the weather changing. 

{% maincolumn "http://jablevine.com/assets/img/dc_ft_ph_climate.png" "" %}

Temperatures don't change here. On clear days, which are increasingly common as the rainy season ends, there's no difference between October and February. This has absolutely thrown off my internal clock. While beach weather everyday is pleasant, I'm looking forward to being somewhere with a bit more variability in seasons.

## Reading <a name="books"></a>

I have an increasingly hard time picking books to read. Last year, I had my favorite book bloggers, and I went through all of their recommendations, and skimmed off the ones I was confident that I would enjoy. In some sense, I'm jealous of my friends who keep their Goodreads account up-to-date. Whatever my book-choosing algorithm is, Amazon's is likely better. 

However, I do have a philosophical problem with Goodreads' book-rating system. A five-star score can be useful, as a single dimensional measure of a books quality: one friend mentions that he only reads books with a 3.9 or higher average rating. But this dimension only captures some of what makes me want to read a book. One issue is that some of my favorite books are just *terrible*. My book choices don't always optimize for book quality. One of my favorite books to re-read is "1632". If you're interested in how West Virginians could reinvent a modern industrial base using technology from Early Modern Germany, these stories are for you. By some sci-fi, an Appalachian mining town is time-traveled to the middle of the Thirty Years' War, and the rednecks "bring the American Revolution to Europe: 150 years ahead of schedule!"{% sidenote "tag" "Actual tagline." %} The writing is overburdened with fictional and historical characters and technical minutiae. Take one plotline: the local hippie ("Stoner") becomes invaluable to the war effort against the Hapsburgs due to his background in "pharmaceuticals." There are [pages and pages](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57257.Grantville_Gazette_III) of details on the making of sulfa drugs and analgesics. Unsurprisingly, the median Goodreads reviewer leaves this book three stars.{% sidenote "gleech" "For an opposite view, see [Gleech's](https://www.gleech.org/books) <q>sort by controversy,</q> the books for which his rating most disagrees with the Goodreads average. All of them are, in his opinion, overrated, i.e., he rates them low and the average reader rates them highly. " %}

There's an extensive literature on ratings systems.{% sidenote "legion" "And if there weren't, Amazon's [secret squad](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/13/tech/amazon-economists/index.html) of [economists](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/19-027_7e890058-c225-4803-a6f1-a6eb1db74027.pdf) would create one." %} Across Amazon product reviews, Uber ratings, and movie scores, anything below 4 is considered sub-par. But intuitively, a 3 should be average. I sometimes dream about systems where raters have to provide uniformly distributed results. Instead, ratings are right-skewed, making it difficult to distinguish the great from the excellent. This makes no sense to me, and has apparently irritated me for years: here's a [screenshot](https://jablevine.com/assets/img/skewed.png) from a friend's instagram in 2017, when I was already complaining!

This month, I also spent hours reading memos from [this list](https://sriramk.com/memos) compiled by Sriram Krishnan at Andreessen Horowitz. 

In their memos, Zuckerberg, Jobs, and Gates shine as convincers. The [acquisition of Instagram](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck_systrom.pdf), one for the history books, wasn't decided by accountants or in board rooms, it closed because Mark Zuckerberg kept writing emails to Kevin Systrom. The emails are well-written, of course, but more interesting is that Zuckerberg took so much time to write them. Another tech memo which provided a good perspective was [Jobs on iBooks](https://sriramk.com/memos/jobs-ibooks.pdf). Amazon has firmly won the e-books war,{% sidenote "war" "Unlike [some](https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2021/09/why-are-ebooks-so-terrible/620068/), I don't think this is a [bad thing](https://jablevine.com/older/september_2021)." %} but it wasn't a sure thing. Jobs aggressively lobbies James Murdoch (!) to have HarperCollins sign a deal with Apple to distribute their ebooks at a substantial markup from Kindle prices. 

> The reason we are doing this is that, with our experience selling a lot of content online, we simply don’t think the ebook market can be successful with pricing higher than $12.99 or $14.99. Heck, Amazon is selling these books at $9.99, and who knows, maybe they are right and we will fail even at $12.99. But we’re willing to try the price as we proposed.

Krishnan calls this email thread "infamous," so there's history which I haven't read. If anyone has reading recommendations on the history of the ebook market, please send it along! "[Book Wars](https://smile.amazon.com/-/es/dp/1509546782/?psc=1)" by Thompson is on my reading list, but ironically not worth $28 for the Kindle version.

Krishnan's list has just five government memos, of which two are from political campaigns and one is from Du Pont Chemical company. The political ones are fascinating: read Hillary Clinton's 2008 chief strategist on how to [take down a junior senator from Illinois](https://sriramk.com/memos/penn-memo.pdf). Obama was "all sizzle and no steak," he "lacks American roots," and he's "unelectable except perhaps against Attila the Hun."

This isn't the pinnacle of government memo writing. Some government memos probably contain too much CYOA to be interesting. On the other hand, as Krishnan notes, memos "typically seem to come into the public domain in one of three ways: through being really old, being part of some lawsuit/legal process or, sadly, being part of a hack." The most interesting ones come from hacks, and these are the ones Krishnan is least likely to put on his website. 

One of the most exciting war books I read this year was mostly a summary of memos and conversations about the Iraq war decision. "[Leap of Faith](https://smile.amazon.com/Leap-Faith-Negligence-Americas-Greatest/dp/1541768361?)" by Michael Mazarr collected memos from the White House, Pentagon, and NSC, which become characters in the story of Iraq. Donald Rumsfeld comes off the worst in his memo writing: one "urgent" (and unexplained) memo penned from his desk in 2002 reportedly read, in its entirety, "Sunni vs. Shia??" Rumsfeld was also deeply possessive of his briefings:

> If people began taking notes, he would sometimes tell them to stop. In one such session, according to someone present, [Condoleezza ] Rice said she wanted to keep her copy of the slides. Rumsfeld refused and reached for them. The two were actually pulling the slides back and forth until Rice appealed to Bush, who was sitting at the head of the table: “Mr. President, I need to keep these.” Bush merely shrugged and left the room. Rice eventually surrendered her copy, but sent a staff member to the Pentagon to find another. 

We probably undervalue the memo. The most important one on Krishnan's list is from IBM's Thomas Watson, aimed at adjutants working in the Pentagon during WWII. The focus is on "completed staff work."

> "Completed Staff Work" is the study of a problem, and presentation of a solution, by a staff officer, in such form that all that remains to be done on the part of the head of the staff division, or the commander, is to indicate his approval or disapproval of the completed action. 

Everyone I've ever worked for has been a busy person. They don't read what I write to learn, they read to act. When I was consulting, a memo could change policy or strategy. Now, working for researchers, a memo (occasionally taking the form of a literature review) informs experimental design or field planning. A good memo isn't information, it's action. 

## Listening <a name="music"></a>

Here is a list of records I listened to for the first time this month and liked (no star) or loved (star). 

* "Midnight Organ Fight," Frightened Rabbit ⭐
* "Soul Food: Cooking with Maceo," Maceo Parker   
* "Pomegranates," Nicolas Jaar
* "In Rainbows," Radiohead
* "Ormenion," Evritiki Zygia ⭐ 
* "First Rose of Spring," Willie Nelson
* "Recomposed by Max Richter: Vivaldi – The Four Seasons"
* "SONGWRIGHTS APOTHECARY LAB," Esperanza Spalding

Also, Krishnan's list of memos includes this (undated, but presumably mid-2000s) [Dave Goldberg memo](https://sriramk.com/memos/goldberg-music.pdf) on the future of the music industry. The memo was sent to Sony CEO Michael Lynton, and was released in the aftermath of the massive Sony Pictures hack. The document is fantastic for the facts it uses to frame the industry,{% sidenote "facts" "<q>Catalog provides 50% of the revenue and 200% of the profits of recorded music.</q>" %}  its forecasts (all eventually proven true),{% sidenote "forecast" "<q>Physical distribution is going away—it doesn’t need to be eliminated prematurely but it needs to follow digital and not drive it.</q>" %} and the final recommendations for how Sony can place itself in the market.{% sidenote "future" "<q>If Netflix wanted to pay 200MM per year to give all of its 40MM subs a music subscription—that should be encouraged, not scoffed at. The goal for digital is for subscription and ad-based services to become the predominant means for people to access music.</q>" %} I learned more in these two and a half pages about the music industry than reading industry news.

## Writing <a name="writing"></a>

I received many useful comments on the draft of my paper on the long reflection, thank you to everyone for reaching out! I also found a pretty egregious coding error in my paper on the role of start-up cities in emigration reduction. Working with cross-national opinion data is hard. Both of these projects are back on the drawing board for now.

In the first days of October, I'm presenting a new paper on the natural resource curse at APSA 2021 in Seattle. The slides are [here](https://jablevine.com/papers/levine_harish_APSA2021.pdf), and we're finishing up a full working draft in the early weeks of the month. This draft is my writing sample for PhD applications in the Winter, so I would more than appreciate any comments! Please reach out if you're interested, or have even a second to take a look.

I'm also spending an inefficient amount of time writing and re-writing the personal statements for my PhD applications. One mentor who's recently been through the process remarked that, at this point, everything else about the application has been locked in (GRE, GPA, LoRs, CV). Even though the personal statement has a minimal role in admission decisions, it intuitively feels like the last bit of the application under my control. 

## Eating <a name="food"></a>

I moved apartments in early September, and, as part of the welcome package to my new home, I inherited about 25 cans of chickpeas. I have boiled, toasted, roasted, baked, crushed, smushed, blended, and devoured these cans, with the goal of working through Wikipedia's [list of chickpea recipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chickpea_dishes).

The most common response I've gotten, when I bring up my chickpea binge, is that I *must* re-try all of these recipes with dried chickpeas. This won't be happening: no increase in quality is worth the 12+ hours of planning involved in rehydrating and cooking dried chickpeas. But I appreciate your concern.

## September, 2021

I don't really know what's going on in Afghanistan. Having visited twice, I'm the go-to expert for questions from grandparents, uncles, and family friends. I don't mind; I'm happy to share my experiences, even if I can't provide any insight into gepolitics.{% sidenote "slide" "I've got a pretty good slide show, too." %} Despite this, I'd like to put my ignorance on the record. 

Most of my time in the country was spent in the Panjshir valley, <strike>now the only region not under Taliban control. Any resistance—organized or not—against the new regime will be organized or supplied from this small province north of Kabul</strike>.{% sidenote "strike" "2021-09-08: this became wrong faster than I expected." %} The valley has played host to human conflict for  at least the whole period covered in my high school history classes. {% marginfigure "missile_cone" "assets/img/missile_cone.jpg" "Panjshiri traffic cone." %}Alexander the Great passed through on his way to and from India, and Tamerlane camped in the field where the provincial football stadium now stands. Along the main highway, kids have turned burned-out Russian tanks into playgrounds; the tailcones of MiG-dropped gravity bombs are used as traffic cones. And there are so many discarded artillery shells from various occupiers that Panjshiris use them in construction.{% marginfigure "roof" "assets/img/shell_roof.jpg" "The support beams in the roof are disarmed tank shells, leftover from the Soviet invasion." %}

If there's one thing I've gained from the disaster of the past month, it's a realistic view of what social scientists can and can't do. Nation building, as a project, failed. This was not for a [shortage of expertise](https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/tetlock-and-the-taliban). The Pentagon was focused on shoring up Afghan capabilities as early as 2004, and brought in academics and subject matter experts to make a plan. I've met dozens of members of the Provincial Reconstruction Teams; each one was a smart, dedicated person who believed they were going to leave their corner of Afghanistan stronger than they found it. The expertise wasn't limited to the Americans: former President Ashraf Ghani had a PhD from Columbia and co-authored a book called "Fixing Failed States." Despite mountains of diplomas and years of [resiliency](https://unama.unmissions.org/afghanistan-2020-conference-programme) conferences, Afghanistan crumbled over one weekend. 

That's what we can't do. What can we do? 

{% maincolumn "assets/img/af_mort.jpg" "[Source](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X). Between 2003 and 2015, child mortality in Afghanistan fell by 29 percent. Maternal mortality fell from 1,140 per 100,000 (>50x the US rate) in 2000 to 427 per 100,000 in 2017." %}

The US occupation doesn't deserve credit for this as much as the pre-2001 Taliban government deserves blame. There was so much low-hanging fruit that progress was inevitable once international aid started to flow into Afghanistan. But if aid is cut off and international organizations pull out once again, these trends could head in the wrong direction. 

Justin Sandfeur of CGD [commented](https://twitter.com/JustinSandefur/status/1430925532477153290), "we don't know how to build nations. We do know how to reduce infant and maternal mortality." This gets to the heart of what could go wrong. Afghans under the Taliban are worse off: they will die younger, their children will be sicker, and they will have less agency over their own lives.

## Reading <a name="books"></a>

To start on the Afghan theme, I'll include one of my old favorites. After my friend John Gerlaugh invited me on the first trip to Panjshir in 2017, I picked up "A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush,"{% sidenote "economist" "Referenced in the title of [this excellent and important graph](https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/495/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210821_FBC907.png) from The Economist." %} Eric Newby's 1950s travel book about a London clothes salesman (Newby) and a diplomatic friend attempting to climb Mir Samir, the highest unclimbed peak in the Panjshir. As neither had never before attempted to climb anything taller than a stepstool, they fail, repeatedly and hilariously. Evelyn Waugh describes the book as "intensely English," and, sure, the confidence had to come from somewhere. If it's any consolation, Mir Samir has only been summited once since, despite dozens of attempts. This is as close as I ever got: 

{% maincolumn "assets/img/mir_samir.jpg" "" %}

As I mentioned a [couple of months ago](https://jablevine.com/older/june_2021), I do all of my reading in Sierra Leone on my Kindle. The days when a year of field research means "[little or no access to books](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/07/which-books-to.html)"  are gone, thanks to epubs and mobis. Unfortunately, not all books are available as as ebooks. So I took advantage of the only permanent address I have, and ordered a couple dozen books to my parents house in Maryland. Here are some of the highlights I brought back  to Freetown with me. 

The first book I picked up after arriving home was James Scott's "The Moral Economy of the Peasant," based on his fieldwork in Southeast Asia. I don't know how it happened, but my Twitter bubble has fully embraced Scott the anarchist; it often feels like every sixth tweet is about "the art of not being governed" or "legibility."{% sidenote "lieven" "Connecting Scott and Afghanistan is this [excellent essay](https://www.iiss.org/-/media/files/publications/survival/2021/jun-jul/63-3-02-lieven.pdf?la=en&hash=F205819C5051F656A98E4EFAC2BAEE29E83EA7D7) by Anatol Lieven on Yaghistan and the impossibility of governing Pashtuns. HT to [James Crabtree](https://jamescrabtree.substack.com/p/back-after-a-break)." %}  Instead of starting with the classic "Seeing Like a State," "Moral Economy" is more relevant to my current research in Sierra Leone. This was the first book which has captured my intuitions of our duty towards subsistence farmers. Scott focuses on explotaition, not as a positive or a negative, but as fundamental to the moral economy as the concept of markets. The book fails as a self-described work of "Marxist anthropology," because it actually makes sense.{% sidenote "apo" "Apologies to any Marxist anthropologists readers." %}

For a similar reason, I picked up "The Economic Theory of Agrarian Institutions," an edited volume from the 1980s which confused me, because I didn't know that development economists were allowed to do theory. I've read Joseph Stiglitz's introductory essay three times now, and found something new each return. Stiglitz repeatedly reminds the reader that subsistence farmers are rational, whacking you over the head with examples. The recommendation came from Marc Bellemare, who wrote elsewhere, "whenever you find yourself thinking that some behavior you observe in a developing country is stupid, think again."

I also brought back Parfit's "Reasons and Persons." I've read the opening sentence{% sidenote "cat" "<q>Like my cat, I often simply do what I want to do.</q> <br> Parfit, the subject of my [favorite New Yorker profile](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/09/05/how-to-be-good), did not in fact own a cat, nor did he want to. But he liked the sound of this sentence so much that he signed an agreement with his sister to take legal, but not practical, possession of her cat." %} at least a dozen times, and the first hundred pages three times. But I've never been able too crack any deeper on my Kindle or computer screen. 

This is because Parfit stores axioms and thought experiments like variables and functions in a massive DO file. Parfit will define claim S10{% sidenote "s10" "<q>I can rationally ignore desires that are not mine.</q>" %} and posit argument P5{% sidenote "p5" "<q>I can rationally now ignore desires that are not mine now.</q>" %}, so he can write ten pages later that, "according to the Appeal to Full Relativity, if we accept (S10) we should also accept (P5). Since an S-Theorist must accept (S10), but cannot accept (P5), he must reject the Appeal to Full Relativity." This would be easy to follow on a computer screen if moral philosophy were written like code. It's not, though, and having a hard copy is my only hope. After two weeks, I'm further along than I've ever been before,{% sidenote "star" "Up to <q>Simple Teletransportation and the Branch-Line Case</q>, which pulls off the rare argument-from-Star-Trek quite well." %} and enjoying it.  

[Matt Clancy](https://mattsclancy.substack.com/) recently ran the first ever EconTwitter science fiction book club, inspiring me to read Vernor Vinge's "[A Deepness in the Sky](https://smile.amazon.com/Deepness-Sky-Zones-Thought-Book-ebook/dp/B002H8ORKM)." Vinge's work on [technological forecasting](https://arbital.com/p/Vingean_uncertainty/), less well known, is also very impressive. Fitting with Clancy's research focus, "Deepness" is a tremendous work of public and innovation economics. By introducing sci-fi physical constraints, Vinge plays with various models for how governments can push fundamental science forward (or, more often than not, fail). 

Another fun sci-fi economics book was "The City in the Middle of the Night" by Charlie Jane Anders. The economy in Anders' book uses different currencies for each type of good you might want to purchase, which Noah Smith (who consulted on the novel) calls an "utterly insane system." The book also takes place within my favorite astrodynamic phenomena, a [tidally locked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking) planet (or "eyeball earth"). With one side of the planet perpetually scorched and the other perpetually frozen, life can only exist in a twilight band where the two meet.

For the flight back, I carried "Whereabouts: Notes on Being a Foreigner" and Jhumpa Lahiri's "The Clothing of Books." One of my reading goals for the year is to read every word Lahiri has ever published, and it's been a fantastic decision so far. 

As a postscript, it was good to read in my parents' home again. My sisters were there for the whole month, and my reading habits have always bothered them slightly. Not so much what or when I read, but how: I tend to take up far too much space on the couch; I fidget (flicking or folding pages, or flipping the cover of my Kindle); I laugh when I'm amused or gasp when I'm surprised. When I was in high school, I probably enjoyed annoying them. Now, reading near people I love enjoys me the book more. Anne Enright, in an interview in the NYT, captured the feeling well.

> **Describe your ideal reading experience.** <br>
> I like being alone in the center of family. I think this is the way I read as a child, surrounded and private at the same time. I like to feel privileged by the secret contents of the book.

## Listening <a name="music"></a>

In July and August, I took Ted Gioia's [One Hundred Best Albums of 2020](http://tedgioia.com/bestalbumsof2020.html) and listened to a random pick (almost) everyday. 

The only one I regretted listening to was the soundtrack to "**Color Out of Space**", a 2019 horror movie about a Lovecraftian meteor. I have always followed the [Munroe school](https://xkcd.com/2056/) of thought regarding horror movies, and have now learned that this extends to their soundtracks. The highest compliment I can give is "effective."

The album I returned to most frequently was Lyra Pramuk's "**Fountain**". Weird, something hidden. I'm still trying to figure it out.

Also excellent, with broad appeal: Georgie Sweet's "**Misunderstood**" and Shabaka and the Ancestors' "**We Are Sent Here by History**." Shabaka Hutchings on various wind instruments, backed by Ariel Zamonsky on bass, makes this one of my favorite popular jazz albums. I didn't get the afrofuturist vibe which [some reviewers](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shabaka-and-the-ancestors-we-are-sent-here-by-history/) called out; too much fatalism. Start with "The Coming of the Strange Ones."

The album which I recommended to the most friends (which of course says more about my friends than the quality of the music) is Dirty Projectors "**5EPs**." 

The overall winner, however, has to be The Westerlies' "**Wherein Lies the Good**." This is a magical record and the "Entropy" suite which concludes the track listing might be my most-listened to track of 2021.

Finally, being within a three-hour time difference of San Francisco, I was able to listen to many more Giant's games than from Freetown. I was too young to remember, but Jon Miller was the first voice of baseball I heard. Miller broadcast Orioles games until 1997, when he moved to San Francisco. I've listened to him call games from Scotland, Afghanistan, Kolkata, and Sierra Leone. 

I remember one Miller anecdote particularly well. During the 2012 Giants World Series run, my high school English teacher had assigned "Macbeth," which I completely refused to read until the night before the test. The game that night started around 10pm on the East coast, and as I was speedreading through Act 2, Pablo Sandoval stole his first and only base of the year. Miller's call:

> And let us not be dainty of leave-taking <br>
> But shift away. There’s warrant in that theft <br>
> Which steals itself when there’s no mercy left.

It's jarring to hear iambic pentameter on a sportscast. I was only confused for another two pages, however. At the end of Scene 3, Malcom recited the same lines! 

## Writing <a name="writing"></a>

I'm circulating a draft of my paper on the [long reflection](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H2zno3ggRJaph9P6c/quotes-about-the-long-reflection); if this sounds interesting to you, [let me know](https://jablevine.com/hi) and I'll send it along. I've got two other working papers on political economy up on my research page; I'm scheduled to present both of these at APSA 2021 in Seattle.
