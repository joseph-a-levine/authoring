Alexandra Pringle,1/20/24,Thames,"I live on a houseboat on the river Thames in Chelsea. The river is my daily companion, it's the center of my life. I go up and down on its tides, 20 feet twice a day, I go to sleep with the rocking of the tides. I have the birds of the river around me, incredible wildlife, beautiful light. It sings to me.",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A0b9f316d-e259-475c-9725-41148064da85?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=1440&dpr=1,https://www.ft.com/content/64be8d6a-3da9-4c02-bf95-d7c5b830f798
Louise Doughty,9/9/23,Dart,"I went skinny-dipping in the River Dart with a bunch of other authors, all drunk after a big night at the Dartington book festival. It was a moonless night, pitch black and, as it’s a fast-flowing river, quite a dangerous thing to do. The collective stupidity of people who were all clever enough to have written books but still thought it a good idea gives me a small smile to this day. I won’t name names but there were some fairly famous individuals among the silvery forms in that dark, reed-filled water. I’m glad we all made it out.",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A0f491059-4d2e-4489-a281-9e9dfa84dfc7?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=1440&dpr=1,https://www.ft.com/content/6ae63ed1-280a-4bd5-b5f3-118c6724a1e5
Miriam Toews,6/10/23,None,I honestly hate rivers. They hide things. They disturb me and they frighten me.,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Adc95d47a-6856-4262-a173-aa1d888e45e2?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=1440&dpr=1,https://www.ft.com/content/eff8db8a-90af-4eef-a40b-107ce891fa6d
Lydia Davis,10/13/23,Connecticut,"There are two contenders. I once went on a school rafting trip down the Connecticut river, very wide and long, and I have deeply fond memories of that. The other is the Hudson, also wide and long. I have travelled by train down alongside it so often, I know its banks and its birds well.",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A59c81878-2616-495f-80b1-f4a506672857?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=1440&dpr=1,https://www.ft.com/content/76c20173-6665-4894-9529-71f6c2318932
