<h3 id="a-suitable-boy"><em>A Suitable Boy</em></h3>

<p>Iâ€™ve done less re-reading of fiction this year than I usually do. In fact, Iâ€™ve been positively smug about how much new fiction Iâ€™ve exposed myself to this year.<label for="nobel" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="nobel" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Iâ€™m writing this a few days after the Ernaux win (I lost about Â£30 on the betting markets, I had money on Murnane and Edna Oâ€™Brien). Iâ€™d never heard of Ernaux before reading through the contenders sheet last week; I doubt Iâ€™ll read her but only because I have an inexplicable aversion to autofiction.  </span> Earlier this month, however, I returned to one of my old favorites, Vikram Sethâ€™s <em>A Suitable Boy</em>. Seth wrote the book<label for="tome" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="tome" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I read it on kindle the first time, and was astounded to see the size of a hard copy, more than 1,100 pages! It read so fast while I was in Sierra Leone, about a week. Just now, I sprinted through in twelve days, but that felt like quite an achievement.  </span>  instead of studying during his economics PhD at Stanford; heâ€™s joked that it took him â€œeleven years not to finish my PhD.â€ Iâ€™m heartened to know I have a novelist/poet career to fall back on if the economics thing doesnâ€™t work out.</p>

<p>The novel is about a 19-year-old woman, Lata, being pushed towards marriage by her mother in the 1950s; Lataâ€™s choice comes down to three boys of varying suitability: Kabir, Haresh, and Amit. Much of the romantic story takes place in Kolkata, but action branches to Delhi, Lucknow, and Bihar. The <em>scope</em> of the novel led to overly confusing comparisons to <em>War and Peace</em>; Nehru shows up often, and the resignation of Rafi Ahmed Kidwai is covered in detail.<label for="randomshit" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="randomshit" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/shit.gif" /><br /></span>  Unlike Tolstoy, however, Sethâ€™s eye for the political scope is without pretension. His biographizing of Nehru is deeply sympathetic personally but caustic historically. Thereâ€™s a delightful critique of Tolstoyâ€™s â€œmassesâ€ theory of history; agree that history is contingent, itâ€™s not the decisive action of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Man_Theory">Great Men</a> which decides events. But instead of the sum of infinitesimals which is a mass movement, what matters are the unknowable quirks of individuals making decisions.<label for="jfkbo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="jfkbo" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">C.f., JFK misunderstanding what the Joint Chiefs meant when they told him the Bay of Pigs had a â€˜fair chanceâ€™ of success. If only theyâ€™d read <em>Superforecasting</em>. </span> Sethâ€™s portraits of early Indian leadership fits in this school, staunchly against Tolstoyian contingency, but with deep sympathy for it.</p>

<p>The actual question of interest, much more central than  for Natasha, is who is most suitable for Lata? In my memory, before beginning my re-read, Amit was the only choice. I might have had a crush on him myself, and Seth draws him almost as a self-portrait â€” an Oxonian poet and novelist, already acclaimed in the West and Anglophone India, Amit is superlatively sympathetic.<label for="amitd" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="amitd" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The most illustrative bits about him are massive spoilers, so Iâ€™ve put one of my favorite at the bottom; search for â€˜Chatterji.â€™ </span> But thereâ€™s also the deeply romantic potential of the bad-boy Kabir; being Muslim, his presence causes Lataâ€™s mother no end of stress. And Haresh is hardworking and simply adoring of Lata. Tho he starts pathetic, he grows on me the most throughout. At one point, on a train, he makes a list entitled â€œMy Life:â€<label for="trapl" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="trapl" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Moreso than planes or buses, trains inspire lists with grandiose titles. </span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>1. Must catch up with news and world affairs.</em> Haresh felt he had not come off well on this account during his meetings with the Mehras. But his work kept him so busy that sometimes he hardly had time even to glance at the papers.</p>

  <p><em>2. Exercise: at least 15 minutes each morning. How to find the time?</em><label for="exc" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="exc" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Ha. </span></p>

  <p><em>3. Make 1951 the deciding year of my life.</em></p>

  <p><em>4. Pay off debts to Umesh Uncle in full.</em></p>

  <p><em>5. Learn to control temper. Must learn to suffer fools, gladly or not.</em></p>

  <p><em>6. Get brogue scheme with Kedarnath Tandon in Brahmpur working properly.</em> This he later crossed out and transferred to the work-related list.</p>

  <p><em>7. Moustache?</em> This he crossed out, and then rewrote together with the question mark.</p>

  <p><em>8. Learn from good people, like Babaram.</em></p>

  <p><em>9. Finish reading major novels of T.H.</em><label for="hardy" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="hardy" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Thomas Hardy. This is likely the most autobiographical item on Sethâ€™s list. </span></p>

  <p><em>10. Try to keep my diary regularly as before.</em><label for="comm" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="comm" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Who hasnâ€™t written this in a diary before? </span></p>

  <p><em>11. Make notes of my five best and five worst qualities. Conserve latter and eradicate former.</em></p>

  <p>Haresh read over this last sentence, looked surprised, and corrected it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>A Suitable Boy</em> is only slightly an economic novel, but it is an economical one. Sethâ€™s aversion to adverbs is second only to Stephen Kingâ€™s. When he does deploy them, itâ€™s done mockingly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The talkative [guppi] was asking Maan about his love life, and Maan was attempting weakly to fend off the questions. â€œPeopleâ€™s love lives are not very interesting,â€ said Maan, sounding unconvincing even to himself.</p>

  <p>â€œHow can you say that?â€ said the guppi. â€œEvery manâ€™s love life is interesting. If he doesnâ€™t have one, thatâ€™s interesting. If he has one, thatâ€™s interesting. And if he has two, thatâ€™s twice as interesting.â€ He laughed delightedly at his sally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another reason Iâ€™m partial to Seth is our similar taste in Shakespeare: <em>Twelfth Night</em>, my favorite of the comedies, plays an extended role in the plot. Lata is cast as Olivia;<label for="vio" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="vio" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">'â€™The girl who played Viola too was excellent, and Lata enjoyed falling in love with her.â€™â€™ </span> one of her suitors<label for="disa" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="disa" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The Muslim boy disapproved of by Mrs. Mehra. </span>  is a talented, pathetic Malvolio. The version staged in the book, â€œIndian-movie-style, concluded with the last of four songs.â€ And contemplating her niece prior to opening night:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes, sitting here, with the marked script of Twelfth Night open on her lap, Lata substituted the word â€œhappinessâ€ for â€œgreatnessâ€ in the famous quotation.<label for="greatnes" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="greatnes" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">â€˜Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.â€™ </span>  She wondered what one could do to be born happy, to achieve happiness, or to have it thrust on one. The baby, she thought, had arranged to be born happy; she was placid, and had as good a chance as anyone of happiness in this world, her fatherâ€™s poor health notwithstanding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iâ€™ll throw in a long section, my favorite, to conclude. Amit is giving a seminar about his new novel to high society in Kolkata:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œDo you believe in the virtue of compression?â€ asked a determined academic lady.</p>

  <p>â€œWell, yes,â€ said Amit warily. The lady was rather fat.</p>

  <p>â€œWhy, then, is it rumoured that your forthcoming novel â€” to be set, I understand, in Bengal â€” is to be so long? More than a thousand pages!â€ she exclaimed reproachfully, as if he were personally responsible for the nervous exhaustion of some future dissertationist.</p>

  <p>â€œOh, I donâ€™t know how it grew to be so long,â€ said Amit. â€œIâ€™m very undisciplined. But I too hate long books<label for="iron" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="iron" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Quite self-aware, from a novelist on page ~900 of 1,100. </span> : the better, the worse. If theyâ€™re bad, they merely make me pant with the effort of holding them up for a few minutes. But if theyâ€™re good, I turn into a social moron for days, refusing to go out of my room, scowling and growling at interruptions, ignoring weddings and funerals, and making enemies out of friends. I still bear the scars of Middlemarch.â€</p>

  <p>â€œHow about Proust?â€ asked a distracted-looking lady, who had begun knitting the moment the poems stopped. Amit was surprised that anyone read Proust in Brahmpur. He had begun to feel rather happy, as if he had breathed in too much oxygen.</p>

  <p>â€œIâ€™m sure Iâ€™d love Proust,â€ he replied, â€œif my mind was more like the Sundarbans<label for="sund" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sund" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The Sunderbans, a massive jungle straddling the coastal border between Indian and Bangladesh, is most famous as the likely setting Kiplingâ€™s <em>The Jungle Book</em> [EDIT: This is a lie! Iâ€™ve been telling people this fact for years but it turns out Kipling probably had parts of Madhya Pradesh in mind.] The Sunderbans are also the place where Iâ€™ve seen the clearest Milky Way Iâ€™ve ever seen.  </span> : meandering, all-absorptive, endlessly, er, sub-reticulated. But as it is, Proust makes me weep, weep, weep with boredom. Weep,â€ he added. He paused and sighed. â€œWeep, weep, weep,â€ he continued emphatically. â€œI weep when I read Proust, and I read very little of him.â€</p>

  <p>There was a shocked silence: why should anyone feel so strongly about anything? It was broken by Professor Mishra. â€œNeedless to say, many of the most lasting monuments of literature are rather, well, bulky.â€ He smiled at Amit. â€œShakespeare is not merely great but grand, as it were.â€</p>

  <p>â€œBut only as it were,â€ said Amit. â€œHe only looks big in bulk. And I have my own way of reducing that bulk,â€<label for="kindle" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="kindle" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I so, so, so fervently want to introduce Amit to a Kindle. </span>  he confided. â€œYou may have noticed that in a typical Collected Shakespeare all the plays start on the right-hand side. Sometimes, the editors bung a picture in on the left to force them to do so. Well, what I do is to take my pen-knife and slit the whole book up into forty or so fascicles. That way I can roll up Hamlet or Timon â€” and slip them into my pocket. And when Iâ€™m wandering around â€” in a cemetery, say â€” I can take them out and read them. Itâ€™s easy on the mind and on the wrists. I recommend it to everyone. I read Cymbeline in just that way on the train here; and I never would have otherwise.â€<label for="shakesp" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="shakesp" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">All three of Lataâ€™s suitors have affinities for Shakespeare, understandable individually, but cumulatively surprising. Kabir acted in <em>Twelfth Night</em>, and Hareshâ€™s 1951-to-do list was written after â€˜â€˜[it] occurred to him that he was behaving as stupidly as Hamlet.â€™â€™ </span></p>

  <p>Kabir smiled, Lata burst out laughing, Pran was appalled, Mr Makhijani gaped and Mr Nowrojee looked as if he were about to faint dead away. Amit appeared pleased with the effect.</p>

<h3 id="on-memory-as-plot">On memory as plot</h3>

<p>I read two novels, novellas really, by Juan Gabriel VÃ¡squez this month â€” a Colombian novelist with, shall we say, political tendencies. <em>Las reputaciones</em>, or <em>Reputations</em>, stuck with me through two readings, first in English and then Spanish. VÃ¡squezâ€™s plot is fractured and engaging; the narrator is a waning political cartoonist who spends most of his time remembering the future and guessing the past.<label for="spanish" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="spanish" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">When people ask me if I can speak Spanish, I usually say yes, but only about things happening right now. Any conjugations beyond the present are beyond me. </span> A singular event drives the action, but that event happened 20 years ago, and is happening now, and will also happen tomorrow. Itâ€™s a slow moving disaster, one the narrator calls â€œthe meteorite, always com[ing] from behind,â€ but really the meteor already impacted.</p>

<p>He combines the metaphor with some shitty, Whorfian anthropology: â€œFor an indigenous tribe in Paraguay, or maybe it was Bolivia, the past is what is in front of us, because we can see it and know it, but the future is what is behind: what we do not see and cannot know. The meteorite always comes from behind, we donâ€™t see it, we canâ€™t see it. You need to see it, see it coming and step aside. You need to face the future. <em>Itâ€™s a poor sort of memory that only works backwards.</em>â€</p>

<p><strong>Memory</strong> is the key; VÃ¡squez explores the formation of memories, the forgetting of memories, the weaponization of memories, and their anticipation. Anne McLeanâ€™s translation is excellent;<label for="mcle" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="mcle" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I enjoyed her translation of Allendeâ€™s <em>Mayaâ€™s Notebook</em> ages ago. </span>  I have no quibbles except the title. <em>Reputations</em> translates directly from <em>Las reputaciones</em>, but reputations (political, sexual, historical) are not what the book is about. VÃ¡squez is interested in <em>legacies</em>,<label for="legre" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="legre" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">When I chatted to two native speakers about this, they mostly agreed without having read the book. â€˜Legado,â€™ the literal translation of legacy, is much more material in Spanish than English, the primary implication having to do with bequests. </span> and these, not reputations, are the cumulative effect of memories.</p>

<p>In the quote above, I added italics on the last sentence. VÃ¡squez pulls this directly from Chapter 5 of Lewis Carollâ€™s <em>Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There</em>, when Alice is completely perplexed by the retrotemporally-challenged White Queen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œItâ€™s dreadfully confusing!â€™</p>

  <p>â€˜Thatâ€™s the effect of living backwards,â€™ the Queen said kindly: â€˜it always makes one a little giddy at firstâ€”â€”â€™</p>

  <p>â€˜Living backwards!â€™ Alice repeated in great astonishment. â€˜I never heard of such a thing!â€™</p>

  <p>â€˜â€“â€“but thereâ€™s one great advantage in it, that oneâ€™s memory works both ways.â€™</p>

  <p>â€˜Iâ€™m sure mine only works one way,â€™ Alice remarked. â€˜I caâ€™nâ€™t remember things before they happen.â€™</p>

  <p>â€˜Itâ€™s a poor sort of memory that only works backwards,â€™ the Queen remarked.â€</p>

<p>Surbhi, a friend based in NY, recently gave me a passionate review of Ted Chiangâ€™s short story â€œ<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life">Story of Your Life</a>,â€<label for="arr" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="arr" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The movie <em>Arrival</em> was based on the story. </span> which prompted me to return to my favorite essay in the category â€œover-the-top sci-fi short story review/physics lesson.â€ Written, of course, by <a href="https://www.gwern.net/">Gwern</a>, â€œ<a href="https://www.gwern.net/Story-Of-Your-Life">â€˜Story Of Your Lifeâ€™ Is Not A Time-Travel Story</a>â€ lacks Surbhiâ€™s passion but trumps her on exasperation and rigor. Why do I include it in this section, below <em>Alice</em> and <em>The Once and Future King</em>? Because Gwernâ€™s version of â€˜Storyâ€™ is about the xenopsychology of memory. In the story, the narrator, a linguist tasked with learning the language of visiting aliens, tells the story from a single point in time about the future and the past. If you enjoyed the story or movie, youâ€™re likely to enjoy  Gwernâ€™s review:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead, what appears to be precognition in Chiangâ€™s story is actually far more interesting, and a novel twist on psychology and physics: classical physics allows usefully interpreting the laws of physics in both a â€˜forwardâ€™ way in which events happen step by step, but also a teleological way in which events are simply the unique optimal solution to a set of constraints including the outcome and allows reasoning â€˜backwardsâ€™. The alien race exemplifies this other, equally valid, possible way of thinking and viewing the universe, and <em>the protagonist learns their way of thinking by studying their language</em>, which requires seeing written characters as a unified gestalt. This holistic view of the universe as an immutable â€˜block-universeâ€™â , in which events unfold as they must, <em>changes the protagonistâ€™s attitude towards life and the tragic death of her daughter</em>, teaching her in a somewhat Buddhist or Stoic fashion to embrace life in both its ups and downs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I donâ€™t have much to add, nor the time to condense Gwernâ€™s prose, so please <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Story-Of-Your-Life">click through</a> if this strikes you as interesting. All of Chiangâ€™s stories are worth perusing.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, I found a delightful short story by Catherynne Valente,<label for="thirlee" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thirlee" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I seem to remember it being linked to from the EA Forum, but I canâ€™t imagine in what context. </span> whose wrote a book â€œabout a gaseous moth who devours the memory of love.â€ â€œ<a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/valente_08_10/">Thirteen Ways of Looking at Space/Time</a>â€ is written half-autobiographically in the third-person, and half hard sci-fi Bereshit.<label for="beres" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="beres" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">â€˜In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was a high-density pre-baryogenesis singularity.â€™ </span> The relevant bits, on Chiangian memory, are in the even-numbered sections:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œOnce, someone asked the science fiction writer got her ideas. This is what she said:</p>

  <p>â€¦ That everything I write is always already written, and that the science fiction writer is sending messages back to me in semaphore, at the speed of my own typing, which is a retroactively constant rate: I cannot type faster than I have already typed. When I type a sentence, or a paragraph, or a page, or a chapter, I am also editing it and copyediting it, and reading it in its first edition, and reading it out loud to a room full of people, or a room with only one or two people in it, depending on terrifying quantum-publishing intersections that the science fiction writer understands but I know nothing about.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iâ€™ll finish with Le Guin, offering her usual no-nonsense take: â€œI know who I was, I can tell you who I may have been, but I am, now, only in this line of words I write.â€</p>

<h3 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h3>

<p>One weird book was cited in three books I read in late October, frequently enough I had to pay attention.<label for="baa" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="baa" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Probably just a Baader-Meinhof coincidence, but a pretty surprising one. </span> The forward to <em>Alice</em>, written by Peter Hunt, concludes that Charles Dodgson was almost surely a pedophile.<label for="ase" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ase" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">My metrics professor would deduct points for abusing measure theoretic verbiage here, but â€˜almost surelyâ€™ and â€˜almost everywhereâ€™ have always been counterintuitive phrases. To say that something exists â€˜almost everywhereâ€™ in a space both colloquially overstates its frequency â€” it could <em>not</em> happen infinitely many times on null spaces â€” and understates it â€” all of those places have measure zero. Mathematicians need to admit theyâ€™re not good at naming things. </span> Hunt writes that â€œeven the most sympathetic of Dodgsonâ€™s biographers [find] it necessary to face this particular problem directly (given that his index contains the item, â€˜Dodgson, nude female form, attachment toâ€™).â€ In this discussion, Hunt cites â€œJames Kincaidâ€™s pioneering <em>Child-Loving: The Erotic Child and Victorian Culture</em>,â€ which  writes of the <em>Alice</em> books that they want to â€œstand on the threshold of â€¦ a seduction drama.â€</p>

<p>I thought little of this forward, until three days later, when reading Amia Srinivasanâ€™s collection <em>The Right to Sex</em>, I came across a familiar name: â€œIs there no difference in power between Kincaid, author of <em>Child-Loving: The Erotic Child and Victorian Culture</em>,<label for="dunk" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="dunk" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">His research interests are not relevant to Srinivasanâ€™s point â€” the title of his book is used as a dunk, one which lands quite well. </span>  and his student?â€ Srinivasan, in â€œOn Not Sleeping With Your Students,â€ takes Kincaid to task for an â€œabus[ive], pornificationâ€ essay on how he interacts with his students.     Kincaidâ€™s story is fairly involed,<label for="recei" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="recei" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">See page 132-136 of the paperback for the receipts, or search for Kincaidâ€™s name. Libgen is a thing. </span> but Srinivasanâ€™s point is that Kincaid is a pedagogical failure: â€œ[his] focus, as a teacher, should be on directing his studentâ€™s desire away from himself, and towards its proper object: her epistemic empowerment. If this is what the student wants already, then all Kincaid has to do is exercise some restraint, and not sexualise what is a sincere expression of her desire to learn.â€</p>

<p>I recommend the entire collection, and most of Srinivasanâ€™s other writing besides: an essay on <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n19/amia-srinivasan/what-does-fluffy-think">bestiality</a>; an <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2017/january/remembering-derek-parfit">obituary of Derek Parfit</a>; an essay on <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v38/n07/amia-srinivasan/under-rhodes">the Rhodesâ€™ legacy</a>.

<p>I recently found Zhengdong Wangâ€™s blog, which I place in the same category as my own website, but much better. The highlight is his <a href="https://zhengdongwang.com/readme">README</a> page, and the â€œMaximum Funâ€ section sourced some fantastic recommendations.<label for="mafun" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="mafun" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Wang also recommends <em>Intepreter of Maladies</em>, which was my absolutely superlative fiction book I read last year, and <em>Memoirs of Hadrian</em>, which was in the top ten.  </span> He prompted me to finally watch <em>Knives Out</em>, which did not strike me as superlative, but was very very fun. The recommendation which worked out the best for me (so far), was Jeff Smithâ€™s <em>Bone</em> collection. Wang writes, â€œIt feels like you got through a Lord-of-the-Rings-like experience in one sitting. The art is so sumptuous.â€ I have never read/watched <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, and this feels like an odd way to get there, but I enjoyed <em>Bone</em> so much that I might try it. Also, Smithâ€™s shades-of-gray style looks beautiful on my extra-large e-ink tablet.</p>

<h2 id="listening">Listening</h2>

<p>The Oxford Philharmonic is a delight â€” itâ€™s a surprise to find a prolific professional orchestra in such a small city. Since March, Iâ€™ve seen four of the great symphonies performed by at the Sheldonian Theater, along with five smaller showings. Tchaikovskyâ€™s 5thÂ </p>

<p>The Sheldonian is my favourite non-church designed by Wren, much preferred to the old hall at my semi-alma mater.<label for="wren" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="wren" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/Bodleian_Plate.jpg" /><br />The â€˜Wren Building,â€™ on the campus of William &amp; Mary, as depicted by the Bodleian Plate, was probably not even designed by Wren.</span> The concert hall in the Sheldonian is tiny, every seat feels cramped. The D-shaped building is a single room â€” every wall you can see is an externally-facing wall. And every inch of room is used well.</p>

<p>First, the <a href="https://www.sheldonian.ox.ac.uk/building-history">ceiling mosaic</a>, painted by Robert Streater in 1669 and restored in 2008, is titled â€œTriumph of Truth and Learning over Envy, Rapine, and Ignorance.â€ I spent most of Tchaikovskyâ€™s 5th distracted by the ceiling. The main circle consists of anthropomorphized versions of the courses taught at Oxford in the 17th century: Poesy poses with pipes; Mosaical law holds a set of double tablets; Astronomy rests on a giant astrolabe<label for="astrola" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="astrola" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">thanks, Lucy, for figuring this one out with me </span>; Chemistry clutches a crucible. On the south side of the ceiling are the titular outcasts: Envy, covered insnakes, falls away from the circle of divine coursework. Rapine and Ignorance, I learned later, are not visible due to theâ€¦</p>

<p>â€¦Organ installed in the 1880s, which reaches to the ceiling. While the organ is gorgeous, I was disappointed to learn the beautiful facade is now entirely decorative. From an uncited forum comment:Â </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œThe organ was a â€˜Fatherâ€™ Willis of 1877. It was rebuilt by Willis III in 1927/8 to a design of H.P Allen, without any Swell reeds. Harrison &amp; Harrison rebuilt it in 1963 with mutations and a Cromorne on the Choir organ, as was popular at that time.Â Â <br />
Â <br />
â€œThe heating baked the organ, so in 1997 one of the Oxford alumni (a QC,) donated a synthetic instrument. It is said that the pipework remains in situ, though the loudspeakers are concealed within the rather splendid T.G. Jackson case.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was seated directly under the stage-right proctorâ€™s box<label for="fasces" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="fasces" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/sheld_proctor.jpg" /><br />Box for lion-eyed exam proctors.</span> for Brahmâ€™s 1st symphony. I spent most of the intermission speculating with a friend (hi Anna) about the fasces-weilding lions, looking like something out of an Indiana Jones dungeon. The best theory we could come up with is that they are intended to intimidate students sitting their exam in the hall every June.</p>

<p>In mid-June, I returned to the Sheldonian for the Philharmonicâ€™s season closing, a performance of Beethovenâ€™s Choral Fantasy and Choral Symphony, his 9th.Â Written fifteen years apart, these two pieces are closely related; Iâ€™d never heard them side-by-side before. Thereâ€™s this identical transition from C to Eâ™­<label for="keysi" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="keysi" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">All within C major. </span>  in the presto of the Fantasy and the climax of the fourth movement of the symphony; the sequence is jarring on itâ€™s own, but startling with the massive build-ups. The Philharmonischer Chor der Stadt Bonn, the choir from Beethovenâ€™s hometown, traveled to Oxford for the concert and blew the roof off the place.</p>

<p>I was excited for this concert for another reason â€” the pianist for the Choral Fantasy was Marios Papadopoulos, MBE, the music director and conductor of the Oxford Philharmonic Orchestra. My first trip to the Sheldonian, for Tchaikovsky in March, I sat next to the godparents of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concertmaster">concertmaster</a>. This old Jewish couple had traveled up from London for the concert, and boy oh boy did they have gossip about the happenings of the Oxford Phil. Papadopoulos was an especially favored subject â€” with his shock of white hair and hawkish pout, he is an attractive character out of an Alexander McCall Smith novel. By June, I had spent more than a dozen hours watching Papadopoulos sway on his podium, waving down-beats past his hip with a self-satisfied smile. I was thrilled to watch him play Beethoven, and he seemed to have much more fun conducting  while also responsible for the piano.</p>

<p>Most recently, in mid-October, I returned to the Sheldonian for DvoÅ™Ã¡kâ€™s eighth symphony with my friend Johanna, a German economist. Here, the Sheldonian showed its weaknesses. Even halfway up the seats, the trombones sounded directly in our ears.<label for="tromb" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="tromb" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Tho it is likely trombones have gotten much more powerful over the past century.  </span> The eighth symphony sits in an odd place in DvoÅ™Ã¡kâ€™s life â€” one can imagine his friends congratulating him after the grandiose, cosmopolitan, brooding seventh symphony in D-minor, then asking him quietly if heâ€™s doing alright. Itâ€™s possible he overcorrected - the eighth is downright ebullient. Then came the ninth, the <em>New World</em>, his last. Itâ€™s easy to find music historians who claim the seventh as DvoÅ™Ã¡kâ€™s apogee, and others asserting the <em>New World</em> as unsurpassed. Empirically, the ninth has won; today, itâ€™s played much more often than any other DvoÅ™Ã¡k symphony. This must be a historical and cultural accident tho â€” itâ€™s the only great European symphony ever written in Iowa, which makes it enough of a curiosity.</p>

<p>Before each of these performances, I met friends at the White Horse, one of the innumerable 7+-century old pubs scattered around Oxford. The main virtue of the White Horse is itâ€™s proximity to the Sheldonian.</p>

<h2 id="eating">Eating</h2>

<p>Lots of baking and large-group meal experimentation this month. Hereâ€™s a paragraph about smoothies:</p>

<p>The previous residents of our house, mostly staff at the <a href="https://www.governance.ai/">Center for the Governance of AI</a>, left behind a Magic Bullet. Lack of access to a blender, it turns out, was the only thing keeping me from becoming a smoothie guy. Iâ€™ve had smoothies five mornings out of six this month. The staple is a banana at the bottom, frozen blueberries, peanut butter, and chocolate protein powder, but Iâ€™ve tossed in apples, oranges, pineapple, mango, avocado, kale, spinach, walnuts, carrots, broccoli, coconut meat, every berry you can imagine, cucumber, yogurt, and chocolate chips.<label for="smoot" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="smoot" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Not all at the same time. </span> Like most eating trends in my life, I donâ€™t expect this to last long, but Iâ€™m enjoying the heck out of it in the meanwhile.</p>

  <p>Amit, needless to say, was disappointed, but not as much as he might have been. His novel, now that he was free from the worry of handling the Chatterji fortunes, was going well, and many more momentous events were taking place on his pages than in his life. He sank deeper into the novel, and â€” a little disgusted with himself for doing so â€” used his disappointment and sadness to portray that of a character who happened to be conveniently on hand. [â€¦] Perhaps Lata had known that of the three men courting her, the only one who could be rejected without the loss of his friendship was Amit.</p>
