I"¼<p><span class="newthought">This is a small website,</span>  with very few things on it. If for some reason you ended up here, weâ€™d probably have an interesting conversation and you should say hi. You can reach me by email at <a href="mailto:jablevine@gmail.com">jablevine@gmail.com</a> or put some time on my Calendly. I am very good at responding to email, but I only check my inbox at 7am and 6pm; if I havenâ€™t replied within 36 hours, you should follow up, <a href="https://guzey.com/follow-up/">repeatedly</a>.</p>

<p>I have shamelessly copied this gimmick from <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/hi/">Ben Kuhn</a>.</p>
