I"©<p>District Chophouse, the only restaurant outside of security at Dulles International Airport, is a weird place. In my two hours at the centre-most table, I saw:</p>

<ul>
  <li>â€¢a flight attendant in her first week on the job, trying desperately for ten minutes to order a chicken ceasar salad, only to end up with <em>three</em> chicken ceasar salads;</li>
  <li>â€¢three of the palest ex-Marineâ€™s iâ€™ve ever seen, discussing Azerbaijanâ€™s export policies in Virginia drawls;</li>
  <li>â€¢the largest 2pm pours of Merlot Iâ€™ve seen since freshman year; seriously, some of these people were wearing white to fly and it was dangerous;</li>
  <li>â€¢presumably at least a few spies of differing nationalities â€” if you want to meet with an agent before they flee the country, without subjecting yourself to the rigours of our TSA, this is an ideal spot.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what brought me here, drinking a $13 Blue Moon? A three hour layover, and the prospect of not seeing my mom until she flies over to Oxford once the weather turns pleasant. I walked through customs, she hopped on the Dulles Toll Road, and we had a furtive dead drop of our own.</p>

<p>Instead of state secrets, my mom was passing along a new driverâ€™s license â€” mine had mysteriously disappeared<label for="readlos" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="readlos" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Not mysterious. I lost it. </span> in CDMX, just moments before attempting to rent a car to go climb a volcano.<label for="grarr" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="grarr" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Thanks, Robi, for adding me as an additional driver and saving the day. </span> The replacement had arrived at my parentsâ€™ house and</p>

<p>The food was adequate and overpriced. The <a href="https://www.flydulles.com/store/district-chophouse">menu</a> has an impressive breakfast spread, and exactly five non-breakfast options, three of which are burgers.<label for="menu" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="menu" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Filled out by a filet mignon and â€˜fresh salmon with orange beurre blanc.â€™ </span> My medium-rare burger was returned a robust medium-well; my momâ€™s medium-well steak was served with more than a hint of blood. Sweet potato fries and the pickle were far above average. They were not busy.</p>

<p>All airport restaurants provoke an uncanny valley reaction â€” everything is <em>almost</em> right, you could <em>almost</em> be seated at a Sbarro in a mall in Poughkeepsie, but thereâ€™s a Truman Show feeling preventing normality. District Chophouse takes this a bit further, being outside the realm of the TSA. Thereâ€™s a â€œpatioâ€ area outside the â€œdoorâ€,<label for="door" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="door" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Entirely the same as the area inside the door, but with a slightly higher ceiling. </span> and â€œwindowsâ€ facing the Alaska Airlines check-in counter. Twenty meters away, you can see taxis and ubers and spouses attempting to drop off customers and loved ones, and the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Police completely failing to keep traffic moving.</p>

<p>Would I go back? I hope not. Minimizing time in airports is a high priority of my travel planning. Getting through security and achieving access to the cornucopia of Dunkinâ€™ and Potbelly and The Kitchen by Wolfgang Puck should be any travelerâ€™s goal. If you ever arrive at Dulles too early to check in, thatâ€™s your fault, and District Chophouse is an appropriate dessert.</p>
